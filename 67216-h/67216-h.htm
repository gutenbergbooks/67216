<h2 class="nobreak">Introduction</h2>
</div>


<p>In this story Midshipmen Phil Perry and
Sydney Monroe, together with Boatswain&#8217;s
Mate &#8220;Jack&#8221; O&#8217;Neil, act through an historic
drama of a South Sea war.</p>

<p>The same characters have seen active service
in many parts of the world.</p>

<p>In &#8220;A United States Midshipman Afloat,&#8221;
life in a battle-ship of the Atlantic fleet,
together with a typical South American
revolution, furnished the setting. In &#8220;A
United States Midshipman in China,&#8221; the
midshipmen and O&#8217;Neil help to rescue an
American Mission and put an end to a
&#8220;Boxer&#8221; uprising. In &#8220;A United States
Midshipman in the Philippines,&#8221; the same
officers see very active service on board a gun-boat
in co&ouml;peration with the army against the
Filipino insurgents.</p>

<p>In &#8220;A United States Midshipman in Japan,&#8221;
they discover a plot to bring the United States
and Japan into open hostilities over the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_6">[6]</span>
purchase of some foreign war-ships. War is
narrowly averted through the detective work
of the midshipmen and their Japanese classmate
at Annapolis, but now a lieutenant in
the Imperial Navy.</p>

<p>The present volume carries the midshipmen
through further thrilling scenes that occurred
in an island of the far-away South Seas. The
portrayal of native life is faithful and many
of the incidents are historic.</p>

<small>THE RIVAL CHIEFS</small></h2>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">A man-of-war</span> boat propelled by six sailormen
and with the flag of the United States
flying from its staff navigated the tortuous
channel through the fringing coral reef and
landed upon the sandy beach of the harbor of
Ukula.</p>

<p>Three American naval officers from the
cruiser &#8220;Sitka&#8221; stepped from the boat upon
the shore.</p>

<p>In the great public square on Kulinuu
Point at one end of the town many thousands
of the natives of the Kapuan Islands had
gathered. They had come from all the
villages of the islands by special invitation
from the Herzovinian consul for the purpose
of giving welcome to their great war chief<span class="pagenum" id="Page_12">[12]</span>
Kataafa, who had but just returned from five
long years of exile in a foreign land.</p>

<p>Toward this assemblage the three officers
bent their steps. They were shown to their
chairs by obsequious Herzovinian sailors and
found themselves placed with the English
officers from their war-ship in port. The
Herzovinian officers sat close to their consul,
who, in all the splendor of a court uniform,
his chest covered with medals, was enthroned
under a bower of freshly cut shrubs and
flowers.</p>

<p>The American captain, Commander Tazewell,
regarded the Herzovinian officials, a
twinkle of merriment in his eyes.</p>

<p>&#8220;All their paint and powder is on thick,&#8221;
he said, smiling good-humoredly, to his two
companions, Midshipmen Philip Perry and
Sydney Monroe, who had accompanied him
ashore to be present at this novel ceremony.</p>

<p>Phil was gazing with open-eyed admiration
at the handsome islanders.</p>

<p>&#8220;I mean the Herzovinian officers,&#8221; Commander
Tazewell added. &#8220;It&#8217;s a hot day for
special full dress uniform, but &#8216;noblesse
oblige,&#8217; I suppose.&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_13">[13]</span>The American consul, Mr. Lee, accompanied
by the chief justice of Kapua, Judge
Lindsay, walked solemnly behind their sailor
escort and seated themselves in chairs reserved
for them between the English and
American officers. Their ladies were escorted
to seats in another stand.</p>

<p>Mr. Lee remained standing until the two
young women who had accompanied him had
been shown seats, then he sat down with an
audible exclamation of annoyance.</p>

<p>&#8220;Judge,&#8221; he exclaimed, &#8220;be prepared to be
outraged. I know these pig-headed Herzovinians
well enough to appreciate that they
never do things half-way.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;We were fools to come and be insulted,&#8221;
the judge snapped, removing his soft
&#8220;Panama&#8221; and wiping his moist forehead.
&#8220;Look at that stand of theirs; looks like a
Christmas tree&mdash;the very thing to catch the
savage eye. Here are we in our democratic
simplicity.&#8221;</p>

<p>The two midshipmen gazed about; the
wonderful spectacle delighted them. Several
thousands of Kapuan men and women collected
in mathematical accuracy had formed<span class="pagenum" id="Page_14">[14]</span>
a great square about the Herzovinian officials.
In front were the women, garbed in colors of
flaming hue, their dark hair loose over their
shoulders. The scarlet hibiscus blossom
woven into necklaces and entwined in their
blue-black locks was both effective and startling.
The men were naked to the lava-lava
covering about their waists, their copper
brown skins glistening with cocoanut oil.</p>

<p>&#8220;There&#8217;s Kataafa,&#8221; Commander Tazewell
said to his companions at his side. &#8220;He and
Panu-Mafili are rivals to the Kapuan throne,
and the final decision is now in the hands of
Judge Lindsay.&#8221; The midshipmen had arrived
in Kapua only that morning on the
mail steamer from San Francisco.</p>

<p>&#8220;Kataafa is the high chief who has always
rebelled against the king,&#8221; the commander
added. &#8220;The Herzovinians deported him to
one of their penal islands after his warriors
had killed many of their sailors, and now
they are giving him a royal welcome.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Where&#8217;s Panu-Mafili?&#8221; Phil asked excitedly,
after he had feasted his eyes upon the
high chief sitting next the Herzovinian consul.</p>

<p>Commander Tazewell indicated a small<span class="pagenum" id="Page_15">[15]</span>
native squatting on the ground in front of
the assemblage. He seemed dwarfed in comparison
to the giant next him.</p>

<p>&#8220;The big one alongside of him is Tuamana,&#8221;
the commander explained. &#8220;He has always
been loyal to the legal king, and is a fine
character and a great fighter. We&#8217;ll call
upon him by and by.&#8221;</p>

<p>With a flourish of trumpets the ceremony
began. The band then struck up the impressive
Herzovinian national air, and all rose to
their feet.</p>

<p>The Herzovinian consul, Mr. Carlson,
moved forward after the music had ceased.
He held in his hand a paper which he raised
above his head, praying silence.</p>

<p>The midshipmen listened eagerly.</p>

<p>&#8220;What language is it?&#8221; Phil whispered.
He could not recognize a word. From different
quarters of the great crowd could be heard
the native &#8220;talking men&#8221; repeating the
words until they were heard by every native.</p>

<p>Phil riveted his attention upon the sea of
native faces opposite him, endeavoring to surprise
their thoughts, and thus obtain knowledge
of what was being said.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_16">[16]</span>&#8220;I can&#8217;t follow him,&#8221; Commander Tazewell
whispered to Phil, &#8220;but I see it&#8217;s making a
great impression.&#8221; He turned slowly in his
chair to observe the effect upon Judge Lindsay
and Mr. Lee, both of whom spoke Kapuan
fluently.</p>

<p>Judge Lindsay&#8217;s under lip was noticeably
quivering, while Mr. Lee ground his teeth in
silent rage.</p>

<p>An exclamation from Phil caused the commander
to turn again. The tall warrior and
Panu-Mafili, the other candidate for kingship,
had turned their backs upon the speaker
and were talking to their followers behind
them. Almost as one man they obeyed the
call, and nearly five hundred natives slowly
and with great dignity marched away, leaving
a gaping hole in the symmetry of the square.</p>

<p>Mr. Carlson&#8217;s flow of native eloquence
came to a sudden stop. He gazed in apparent
bewilderment about him. Then from the
departing natives came in melodious rhythm
the words, sung over and over again&mdash;&#8220;Malea-Toa-Panu-Tupu-e-Kapua&#8221;&mdash;Malea-Toa
Panu is King of Kapua.</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m afraid I can&#8217;t stand to hear the rest<span class="pagenum" id="Page_17">[17]</span>
myself,&#8221; Judge Lindsay declared, unable to
Control himself longer. He rose to his feet
and walked away with great dignity. Mr.
Lee and the British consul followed.</p>

<p>&#8220;I am going to stick it through,&#8221; Commander
Sturdy, of the British war-ship
&#8220;Hyacinth,&#8221; exclaimed as he changed his
seat to one next to Commander Tazewell.
&#8220;I can&#8217;t understand a jolly word, you know,
but it&#8217;s as good as a musical opera at home.&#8221;</p>

<p>Chief Kataafa now stood beside Mr.
Carlson, while Klinger, the manager of the
Herzovinian firm&#8217;s plantations in Kapua,
called the &#8220;Kapuan Firm,&#8221; called loudly to
the natives for silence.</p>

<p>&#8220;The worst is yet to come,&#8221; Commander
Tazewell laughed. The Herzovinian sailor
company of a hundred strong, their rifles
shining brightly in the sunlight, had smartly
taken the position of &#8220;present arms.&#8221; &#8220;But
quiet must be restored before the remainder
of this impressive ceremony will be retailed
out to us,&#8221; he added impressively.</p>

<p>Mr. Carlson solemnly placed a wreath of
royal yellow about the chief&#8217;s neck. The assemblage
suddenly burst forth in uncontrolled<span class="pagenum" id="Page_18">[18]</span>
savage joy. Then as if by magic this demonstration
was stilled by the music of a gun.
The Herzovinian war-ship was firing a salute
in honor of the returned exiles.</p>

<p>&#8220;Nineteen guns, I suppose,&#8221; Commander
Sturdy said. Every one was counting, the
natives most of all. The nineteenth gun had
fired. All held their breath. This was the
salute usually given a high chief. There
seemed a perceptible pause and then another
crash reverberated across the water, and yet
another.</p>

<p>&#8220;A royal salute,&#8221; all gasped. Again pandemonium
broke loose among the Kataafa
adherents. Herzovinia had acknowledged
Kataafa as king of Kapua.</p>

<p>Commander Tazewell&#8217;s face suddenly
dropped its joviality. The British captain
said things under his breath, while the
American and English officers gazed at each
other, utterly speechless with surprise.</p>

<p>&#8220;Kataafa Tupu-e-Kapua<a id="FNanchor_1" href="#Footnote_1" class="fnanchor">[1]</a>&mdash;ah,&#8221; the song
burst forth, drowning out all other sounds.</p>

<p>The stands were quickly emptied. The
American and English officers joined the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_19">[19]</span>
resident ladies of their nationality and escorted
them in angry silence away from the scene.</p>

<p>Judge Lindsay and Mr. Lee were encountered
only a few hundred yards away. Mr.
Lee called Commander Tazewell to his side.</p>

<p>&#8220;We are waiting to hear from Mr. Carlson
what is the meaning of this treachery,&#8221; he exclaimed.
&#8220;Judge Lindsay goes so far as to
believe that now a war over the title of king of
Kapua cannot be averted. It is outrageous.&#8221;</p>

<p>Phil and Sydney gazed with interest at the
daughters of the American consul, Mr. Lee,
whom they had not met, and were greatly
disappointed when they heard him direct
them to return home immediately. The midshipmen
remained behind with their captain.</p>

<p>The Herzovinian consul, accompanied by
Klinger and a stranger and followed by
several naval officers, soon appeared. Their
faces were wreathed in smiles and their
shoulders were decorated with circlets of
flowers placed there by the jubilant Kataafa
adherents.</p>

<p>Judge Lindsay placed himself squarely in
their path. His face was pale, and he held
his cane clutched firmly in his hand.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_20">[20]</span>&#8220;Mr. Carlson,&#8221; he exclaimed in a clear
vibrant voice, &#8220;I desire you to state to me,
as chief justice of Kapua, publicly and at once,
your authority in making such a speech,
acknowledging for Herzovinia the claim of
Kataafa to be king of Kapua. Further, I
desire to hear the authority for the salute of
twenty-one guns, a salute given only to a
king. As chief justice of these islands I
represent the Herzovinian law as well as the
law of England and America. Do I understand,
sir, that you have set aside law, the
law of the treaty between the three great
nations, and have rendered a decision in favor
of Kataafa, even while I am still deliberating
upon the justice of these two claimant chiefs
for the title of king?&#8221;</p>

<p>Mr. Cartoon&#8217;s face was a study. He looked
appealingly to the stranger beside him as if
for support. Phil was astonished to note the
evident gleam of triumph in the stranger&#8217;s
eyes. The lad regarded him closely. He was
tall and finely built; his face was pale and
highly intellectual in appearance. He appeared
to be a man of great force of character.</p>

<p>&#8220;My dear judge,&#8221; Mr. Carlson floundered<span class="pagenum" id="Page_21">[21]</span>
hopelessly. &#8220;Come with us to the consulate.
This is really not the place for dispute.&#8221;</p>

<p>They had been surrounded by inquisitive
natives of all sizes, who are quick to scent an
altercation, and even though not understanding
the words, like all nature&#8217;s children, can
read the language of the eye, the face and the
hand.</p>

<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t dear me,&#8221; the judge exclaimed, even
more angrily. &#8220;Your treachery was public;
my condemnation of it shall be public also.&#8221;</p>

<p>Mr. Carlson&#8217;s face streamed with perspiration.
He was a big man and inclined to be
fat. His gorgeous uniform fitted like a glove.
Under a torrid sun he was a picture of woe.</p>

<p>The stranger whispered in the consul&#8217;s ear.
Phil noted that the red face suddenly cleared.</p>

<p>&#8220;You have misunderstood, judge,&#8221; Mr.
Carlson began, not at all certain of his ground,
but his voice gained strength as he continued.
&#8220;I did not say he was Tupu<a id="FNanchor_2" href="#Footnote_2" class="fnanchor">[2]</a> of Kapua. That
you must decide. I only hailed Kataafa as
Tupu. Being the choice of so many villages
makes him Tupu. That was my meaning.
Kataafa and Panu-Mafili are both Tupu, but<span class="pagenum" id="Page_22">[22]</span>
neither is yet Tupu-e-Kapua.&#8221; Mr. Carlson
was now smiling benignly upon the judge.</p>

<p>Judge Lindsay made a sign of disgust.</p>

<p>&#8220;Do you take me for a babe in arms?&#8221; he
exploded. &#8220;How dare you insult my intelligence
by such an absolute and unnecessary
falsehood! Whether you know what you
read or not, I do know. I heard and understood.
You did not mince matters there.&#8221;
He drew himself up haughtily and glared
defiantly and for the first time at the stranger
and Klinger.</p>

<p>&#8220;The Kapuan language, to one who knows
it, is not difficult. I advise you, Mr. Carlson,
hereafter to stick to a language you know,
otherwise your able co-conspirators will be
putting embarrassing words into your innocent
mouth.&#8221;</p>

<p>A ripple of suppressed merriment rose unrebuked
at the judge&#8217;s sally. Mr. Carlson
seemed too dazed and worried to make any
reply.</p>

<p>The judge bowed ceremoniously, linking
his arm in that of Mr. Lee, and walked away.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER II<br />


<small>DISCORD AMONG THE WHITES</small></h2>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">The</span> day after the ceremony of welcome to
Kataafa, Phil and Sydney again accompanied
their captain on shore. Commander
Tazewell took a lively interest in everything
that was going on and was delighted to have
such enthusiastic young supporters.</p>

<p>&#8220;You&#8217;ll find,&#8221; he said after they had landed
and sent the boat away, &#8220;that the natives
of both factions are equally friendly to us.
That is a good sign and I hope it will continue.&#8221;</p>

<p>The highroad of Ukula was filled with half-naked
muscular men and lithe, graceful, dark-eyed
women. Every native exhaled the acrid
odor of cocoanut oil. The men&#8217;s long hair
was plastered white with lime and tied on top
in the form of a topknot.</p>

<p>&#8220;The lime bleaches the hair red, you know,&#8221;
Commander Tazewell explained, noting the
lads&#8217; curiosity at this peculiar custom. &#8220;The<span class="pagenum" id="Page_24">[24]</span>
oil is to prevent them from catching cold.
They go into the water, you see, any hour of
the day, and when they come out they are as
dry as ducks.&#8221;</p>

<p>The officers had landed at Kulinuu, the
traditional residence of the Malea-Toa family,
from which many kings had been chosen and
to which Panu-Mafili belonged. On every
hand they encountered good-natured smiling
natives. &#8220;Talofa, Alii&#8221;<a id="FNanchor_3" href="#Footnote_3" class="fnanchor">[3]</a> was on every lip.</p>

<p>&#8220;Ten thousand of these fellows are encamped
in the vicinity of Ukula waiting to
see who the chief justice makes their king,&#8221;
the commander said. &#8220;You see,&#8221; he added,
&#8220;strange as it may seem to us, two chiefs may
rightfully be elected. Election depends upon
quality of votes rather than upon quantity.
So according to traditional Kapuan custom
when two kings are elected, they decide it by
having a big battle. That is the normal way,
but we have persuaded the natives that arbitration
is more civilized. Now the chief justice
decides and the three nations support that
decision.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It looks rather as though Herzovinia<span class="pagenum" id="Page_25">[25]</span>
would support the judge only in case he decides
for Kataafa,&#8221; Sydney said questioningly.
&#8220;If that country refuses to back up the judge
what will happen?&#8221;</p>

<p>Commander Tazewell was thoughtful for
half a minute.</p>

<p>&#8220;According to the treaty all are required
to agree,&#8221; he answered. &#8220;There is no choice.
Once the decision is made that creates a king,
all who oppose him are rebels. That is the
law, and these foreign war-ships are here to
uphold Judge Lindsay&#8217;s decision, right or
wrong.&#8221;</p>

<p>As the three pedestrians, dressed in their
white duck uniforms, white helmets protecting
their heads from the tropical sun, reached
the hard coral road leading along the shore
of the bay, the panorama of the harbor opened
and delighted the eyes of the young men.</p>

<p>The white coral reef, lying beneath scarcely
half a fathom of water, was peopled by natives
gathering shell-fish to feed the greater influx
of population. On the bosom of the dark
green water, beyond the inner reef, and almost
encircled by spurs of a second ledge of
coral, lay anchored the war-ships of three<span class="pagenum" id="Page_26">[26]</span>
great nations. In the foreground, lying on
their sides, two twisted red-stained hulls, the
bleaching bones of once proud men-of-war,
told of the sport of giant waves that had
hurled them a hundred yards along the inner
reef and drowned many of their crews. This
manifestation of the power of a tropical hurricane,
that might come almost unheralded
out of the watery waste, prevented any relaxation
of vigilance. At all times the war-ships
were kept ready to seek safety at sea, clear of
the treacherous coral reefs. To be caught at
anchor in the harbor of Ukula when a hurricane
broke could mean only another red-stained
wreck upon the reef.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_27">[27]</span></p>

<div class="figcenter"><img src="images/i_027.jpg" alt="" /></div>
<p class="caption">MAP OF UKULA</p>

<p>The road soon left the water&#8217;s edge. Now it
ran several hundred yards inland through
groves of cocoanut, banana and breadfruit
trees. Fringing the road were many spider-like,
grass-thatched native houses, similar to
those they had seen among the groves at
Kulinuu. Seated on mats under these shelters
were numerous natives, and the Americans as
they progressed received frequent cordial invitation
to stop and refresh themselves from
the very hospitable islanders. Commander<span class="pagenum" id="Page_28">[28]</span>
Tazewell, during his stay in Kapua, had
acquired some facility in the language, which
greatly delighted the childlike natives, and
they lost no opportunity to engage him to join
their meetings, in order that they might listen
to their own language from the lips of a
&#8220;papalangi&#8221;<a id="FNanchor_4" href="#Footnote_4" class="fnanchor">[4]</a> chief. But apparently the commander
did not intend to stop. Both midshipmen
now eyed longingly the cool interior
of a large and pretentious house which they
were approaching. From the entrance a
stately warrior beckoned them to come and
partake of the milk of a cocoanut.</p>

<p>Commander Tazewell waved a solemn acknowledgment.
&#8220;That&#8217;s Tuamana, the chief
of Ukula,&#8221; he said to his companions. &#8220;We&#8217;ll
stop for just a minute. It was he,&#8221; the
commander added as they approached the
delighted chief, &#8220;who saved so many lives
during the hurricane when those two war-ships
were thrown up bodily on the reef, and
several others were wrecked at their moorings.&#8221;</p>

<p>Tuamana grasped each by the hand in turn
and then led them to mats laid upon the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_29">[29]</span>
pebbly floor. He clapped his hands, and
almost at once from behind the dividing curtain
of &#8220;Tapa&#8221;<a id="FNanchor_5" href="#Footnote_5" class="fnanchor">[5]</a> cloth, two native girls glided,
gracefully and with outstretched hands, to the
side of the &#8220;papalangis.&#8221; Seating themselves
the girls began industriously fanning the
heated officers. Phil soon appreciated the
reason for this delicate attention; swarms of
flies hovered about them, to fight which alone
would soon exhaust one&#8217;s patience.</p>

<p>Commander Tazewell and Chief Tuamana
engaged in quiet conversation in Kapuan
while the chief&#8217;s talking man, a native educated
at one of the mission schools, came
frequently to their aid when the commander&#8217;s
limited native vocabulary gave evidence of
being inadequate.</p>

<p>Phil and Sydney were thus left free to
enjoy the novelty of their surroundings.</p>

<p>The two young girls fanned and giggled in
turns until Phil, unused to such delicate
attention from the opposite sex, insisted upon
taking the cleverly wrought banana leaf fan,
and much to the amusement of the two girls
began fanning himself and the girl too.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_30">[30]</span>
After a few moments this young lady arose,
bowed and disappeared behind the screen
convulsed with laughter.</p>

<p>&#8220;You&#8217;ve offended her,&#8221; insisted Sydney.
&#8220;Haven&#8217;t you learned yet to give women
their own way?&#8221;</p>

<p>But Phil&#8217;s gallantry was to receive its
reward. A third graceful Kapuan girl, her
high caste face beaming upon them, glided
through the tapa screen. Bowing low before
Commander Tazewell, she took the vacant
place at Phil&#8217;s side.</p>

<p>Commander Tazewell made a jesting remark
in Kapuan, which caused every one to laugh
except the two midshipmen.</p>

<p>&#8220;This is Tuamana&#8217;s daughter Avao,&#8221; the
commander said. &#8220;I told her she&#8217;d have a
difficult time making a choice between my
two handsome aides; but I see she has made
up her mind already.&#8221;</p>

<p>Avao had taken the fan from Phil&#8217;s hand
and was now efficiently fanning him.</p>

<p>A half hour later as they were standing,
bidding good-bye to their hosts, Commander
Tazewell announced to Phil that the chief&#8217;s
daughter had paid him a signal honor.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_31">[31]</span>&#8220;She wants you to be her felinge,&#8221;<a id="FNanchor_6" href="#Footnote_6" class="fnanchor">[6]</a> he
said, his grave eyes sparkling. &#8220;It&#8217;s a
Tapau&#8217;s<a id="FNanchor_7" href="#Footnote_7" class="fnanchor">[7]</a> privilege to choose. Your obligation
is to present her with soap, tooth powder,
in fact, anything she fancies that you can get
in the ship&#8217;s store. For this you are privileged
to drink as many cocoanuts and eat as much
fruit as you desire at her father&#8217;s house. She
will even send you presents of fruit, tapa
and fans. If I were Mr. Monroe, I&#8217;d envy
you your luck, for Avao is the belle of Ukula.&#8221;</p>

<p>Avao blushed under her bronze and playfully
struck the commander with her fan.</p>

<p>&#8220;Leonga Alii!&#8221;<a id="FNanchor_8" href="#Footnote_8" class="fnanchor">[8]</a> she exclaimed abashed.</p>

<p>&#8220;She understands and speaks English as
well as I do,&#8221; he said, laughing at the girl&#8217;s
sudden shyness. &#8220;Once I thought she&#8217;d make
me her felinge, but I suppose youth takes
rank.&#8221;</p>

<p>Once more on the road Commander Tazewell
became again serious.</p>

<p>&#8220;That affair yesterday is taking on a darker
aspect,&#8221; he confided. &#8220;Tuamana says that
every one knows among the natives that if<span class="pagenum" id="Page_32">[32]</span>
Judge Lindsay decides for Panu-Mafili then
Kataafa has been persuaded by the Herzovinians
to make war.</p>

<p>&#8220;Tuamana, of course,&#8221; he added, &#8220;is a
loyal man. He is on Panu&#8217;s side, but will be
loyal to whom Judge Lindsay decides is really
the king.&#8221;</p>

<p>In front of the big wooden store in the
Matafeli district of the town, Commander
Tazewell stopped. Many natives were gathered
there. The porch was crowded, while
within the store there seemed to be only
standing room.</p>

<p>&#8220;What mischief is going on here?&#8221; he exclaimed,
a perplexed frown on his face.</p>

<p>Suddenly Klinger and the stranger of yesterday
darkened the doorway. The stranger
gazed coldly upon the Americans but gave no
sign of recognition. He and Klinger continued
to talk in their guttural Herzovinian
tongues.</p>

<p>Phil suddenly observed that the air of
friendliness they had noted earlier was now
lacking. The natives no longer greeted them.
Instead in the native eye was a sheepish, sullen
look.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_33">[33]</span>&#8220;That was Count Rosen,&#8221; Commander
Tazewell said as they again moved onward.
&#8220;Klinger, of course, is active and sides with
Kataafa. Klinger&#8217;s wife is a native, you
know, a close relative of the high chief. I
suppose he&#8217;d like to have royalty in the family.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;The store looked like a recruiting station,&#8221;
Phil suggested.</p>

<p>Commander Tazewell nodded gravely. &#8220;It
may be,&#8221; he replied.</p>

<p>The Matautu section of Ukula, set aside
for the official residences of the consuls of
England and the United States, was being
approached.</p>

<p>At the gate of the American consulate, Mr.
Lee hailed them. The consul was naturally
a peace loving man, and the fact that he had
with him in Kapua his two daughters was an
added argument for peace.</p>

<p>&#8220;Come in, commander,&#8221; he called from his
doorway.</p>

<p>They turned in through the gateway.</p>

<p>&#8220;All manner of war rumors,&#8221; Mr. Lee exclaimed,
as he shook hands, &#8220;are going the
rounds. The latest is that a paper has been<span class="pagenum" id="Page_34">[34]</span>
found written by Herzovinian statesmen some
years ago declaring their country would never,
never permit Kataafa to be king. The
Kapuans believe that this will make Judge
Lindsay decide for Panu-Mafili. Until that
disgraceful affair of yesterday, and the rumor
of this paper, we all thought that whatever
the decision the three consuls would unite to
prevent war. Panu-Mafili has said openly he
and his followers would abide by the decision.
Kataafa appeared willing, but has as yet
made no statement.</p>

<p>&#8220;The situation is alarming, commander,&#8221;
Mr. Lee added gravely, &#8220;and I for one am at
a loss what should be done.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Arrest the white men who are inciting
Kataafa to revolt in the event of an adverse
decision and ship them from Kapua; that&#8217;s
my remedy,&#8221; Commander Tazewell answered
promptly.</p>

<p>&#8220;Count Rosen and Klinger,&#8221; the consul
exclaimed. &#8220;Impossible!&#8221;</p>

<p>Commander Tazewell shrugged his shoulders.</p>

<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s the one way to prevent war,&#8221; he
said.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_35">[35]</span>&#8220;The Herzovinian consul, after agreeing to
stand with us and prevent a war, has now
assumed a mysterious air of importance and
we can get nothing definite from him,&#8221;
Mr. Lee complained bitterly. &#8220;If my advice
had only been followed and Kataafa kept
away until after a new king had been crowned,
this perplexing state could not have existed.&#8221;</p>

<p>Commander Tazewell was thoughtful for
several minutes.</p>

<p>&#8220;Mr. Lee,&#8221; he said gravely, &#8220;I believe
that bringing Kataafa back at this time was a
Herzovinian plan. The chief has been in exile
for five years and in a Herzovinian colony,
and I hear was treated as a prince instead of
a prisoner. Although his warriors killed
Herzovinian sailors in the last revolt, now he
favors that nation. Once he is king of Kapua
he will advance all Herzovinian interests.
They may hope even for annexation, a dream
long cherished by Klinger and his countrymen.</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, if the judge decides against Kataafa
there will be war,&#8221; he concluded solemnly.</p>

<p>Phil and Sydney listened eagerly. Though
these native affairs were not easy to understand,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_36">[36]</span>
yet they could not interrupt and ask
for explanations.</p>

<p>At this time there came an interruption in
the serious talk between Commander Tazewell
and Mr. Lee. It was the arrival of the two
young ladies. They had been out in the
&#8220;bush,&#8221; as the country back of the sea beach
is called in Kapua. They appeared, their
young faces glowing with health from their
recent exercise and their arms full of the
scarlet &#8220;pandanus&#8221; blossoms.</p>

<p>Margaret, the older girl, was a woman in
spite of her nineteen years. She greeted the
newcomers to Kapua with a grace that won
the midshipmen at once. Alice, two years
her junior, caught the boyish fancy of the
lads instantly. She seemed to carry with her
the free air of the woods, and exhaled its
freshness. She had scarcely a trace of the
reserve in manner of her older sister. Her
greeting was spontaneously frank and unabashed.</p>

<p>While Margaret presided at the tea table,
around which Commander Tazewell and the
consul gathered, Alice impressed the willing
midshipmen into her service, and with their<span class="pagenum" id="Page_37">[37]</span>
arms loaded with the pandanus flowers, led
them to the dining-room. Here she placed
the brilliant blossoms into numerous vases,
giving to the room with its paucity of furniture
a gala aspect.</p>

<p>&#8220;Do you care for tea?&#8221; she said questioningly,
implying clearly a negative answer,
which both lads were quick to catch.</p>

<p>&#8220;Never take it,&#8221; Phil replied quickly. &#8220;Do
you, Syd?&#8221;</p>

<p>Sydney smiled and shook his head.</p>

<p>&#8220;Because if you don&#8217;t, while the others are
drinking it, we can climb Mission Hill back
of the town and enjoy the view of the harbor.
It&#8217;s not far,&#8221; she added glancing at the spotless
white uniform of the young officers.</p>

<p>She led them at a rapid pace across the
garden and by a narrow path into a thickly
wooded copse. The path was apparently one
not frequently used and was choked with
creepers and underbrushes. After a score of
yards the path led at a steep angle up the
wooded side of one of the low surrounding
hills, which at Matautu descended almost to
the harbor&#8217;s edge. Here the shore is rocky
and dangerous.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_38">[38]</span>Alice climbed with the ease of a wood sprite,
while the midshipmen lumbered after her in
their endeavor to keep pace.</p>

<p>&#8220;Here we are,&#8221; she cried joyfully as she
sprang up the last few feet of incline and seated
herself in the fork of a small mulberry tree.</p>

<p>Out of breath, their white trousers and
white canvas shoes stained with the juice of
entangling vines, and with perspiration
streaming in little rivulets down their crimson
faces, the two young men looked with
amazement at their slim pace-maker; she was
not even out of breath.</p>

<p>&#8220;Isn&#8217;t it worth coming for?&#8221; she exclaimed,
perfect enjoyment in her girlish voice. &#8220;See,
the town and the harbor and all the ships lie
at our feet; and everything looks so very
near;&#8221; then she added whimsically, &#8220;I sometimes
pretend I am queen and order everything
and every one about&mdash;no one else ever
comes here,&#8221; she explained quickly. &#8220;My
sister Margaret came once, but never came
again.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s not easy to get here,&#8221; Sydney said,
panting slightly, &#8220;but it would more than
be worth the trouble if by coming one could<span class="pagenum" id="Page_39">[39]</span>
really know the feeling of being a king or a
queen. I haven&#8217;t sufficient imagination.
What should you do if you were queen?&#8221;
he asked of Alice.</p>

<p>She drew her brows down thoughtfully.</p>

<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t know all that I should do,&#8221; she
replied earnestly, &#8220;but the very first thing
would be to send away every papalangi.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;The war-ships too?&#8221; Phil inquired. &#8220;I
call that hospitable!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I might keep you,&#8221; indicating both lads by
a wave of her free hand, &#8220;as leaders for my
army, but every one else would be sent away
and leave these children of nature free to live
their lives as God intended they should.&#8221; A
deep conviction in the girl&#8217;s voice was not lost
upon the midshipmen.</p>

<p>&#8220;Suppose you tell us of Kapua,&#8221; Phil said
gently, after a short silence.</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, do,&#8221; Sydney urged eagerly.</p>

<p>&#8220;Tell you of Kapua Uma,&#8221;<a id="FNanchor_9" href="#Footnote_9" class="fnanchor">[9]</a> Alice said
wistfully. &#8220;I have lived here now three years,
and I feel as if the people were my people.
They are gentle, generous and lovable, except
when they are excited by the papalangi.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_40">[40]</span>
The white men have brought only trouble
and sorrow to the islands. No Kapuan has
ever broken his word, except when the white
men have betrayed him. In all their wars
they have been generous to their foes. They
never harm women and children. The white
men incite war, but are free from injury, except
when they attack the Kapuans first.</p>

<p>&#8220;Once all the rich land near the sea belonged
to Kapua. Now white men have stolen it
away by fraud and deceit.&#8221; Alice&#8217;s eyes
flashed indignantly, while her hearers were
thrilled by the fervor in her young voice.
&#8220;The foreign firm of which Klinger is manager,
called the &#8216;Kapuan Firm,&#8217; owned by
Herzovinian capital, is no ordinary company
of South Sea traders,&#8221; she added. &#8220;It is the
feet of the Herzovinian Empire, holding the
door of annexation open. The firm&#8217;s business
grows greater every year. They import black
labor from the Solomon Islands and hold them
to work as slaves. The treaty gives the
Kapuans the right to choose their king, but
the firm will sanction no king who will not
first agree to further the interests of the
Kapuan firm.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_41">[41]</span>&#8220;Kataafa once fought against the firm and
won, but he was exiled by the Herzovinian
government. Now a majority of people again
wish him for king, and this time the firm is
not only willing but anxious that he should
be made king. England and America represented
in Kapua see in this a bid for
annexation. Judge Lindsay will soon decide
between Kataafa and Panu-Mafili. Panu has
given his word he will not fight. Kataafa
signed a sworn agreement in order to obtain
the consent of the three Powers to his return
from exile, that he would never again take
up arms.&#8221;</p>

<p>Alice stopped breathless. &#8220;There you have
the full history of Kapua in a nutshell,&#8221; she
added laughingly as she slipped down from
her seat.</p>

<p>&#8220;Poor Panu-Mafili is only a boy. His father,
you know, was the late king Malea-Toa or
&#8216;Laupepe,&#8217; a &#8216;sheet of paper,&#8217; as the natives
called him, because he was intellectual. Panu
begged to be allowed to go away and study,&#8221;
she said, &#8220;but our great governments need
him as a big piece in the political chess game.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;More aptly a pawn,&#8221; Phil corrected.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_42">[42]</span>Alice was gazing wistfully seaward.</p>

<p>&#8220;Out there,&#8221; she said after a moment&#8217;s silence,
&#8220;is a sail. It&#8217;s probably the &#8216;Talofa,&#8217;
a schooner from the Fiji. The natives say
&#8216;Bully&#8217; Scott and the &#8216;Talofa&#8217; scent out wars
in the South Seas and arrive just in time to
sell a shipload of rifles.&#8221;</p>

<p>The midshipmen saw the tops of a &#8220;sail&#8221;
far out on the horizon.</p>

<p>&#8220;If Kataafa needs guns to defy the chief
justice, there they are,&#8221; she added.</p>

<p>&#8220;Isn&#8217;t it against the law to sell guns to the
natives?&#8221; Sydney asked.</p>

<p>Alice regarded him with high disdain.</p>

<p>&#8220;&#8216;Bully&#8217; Scott knows no law nor nationality,&#8221;
she replied. &#8220;To give your nationality
in Kapua is a disadvantage, because then
your consul interferes with your business.
When you&#8217;re trading in &#8216;blacks&#8217; and guns,
it&#8217;s best to deprive yourself of the luxury of a
country. &#8216;Bully&#8217; Scott is from the world.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;How do you know that is the &#8216;Talofa&#8217;?&#8221;
Phil asked incredulously, but all the same
greatly interested.</p>

<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t know,&#8221; she answered gayly as she
led the way toward home; &#8220;but the &#8216;Talofa&#8217;<span class="pagenum" id="Page_43">[43]</span>
is a schooner, and the natives believe she will
come. And that&#8217;s a schooner.&#8221;</p>

<p>Her logic was not convincing to the midshipmen,
but then they had not lived three
years in Kapua. Schooners were not frequent
visitors at Ukula.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER III<br />


<small>PLOTTING FOR POWER</small></h2>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">The</span> Herzovinian consul sat upon his wide
verandah gazing out upon the quiet bay of
Ukula. His usually serene face wore a
troubled look. Count Rosen paced the porch
restlessly. His well-knit figure was becomingly
clad in a military khaki riding suit,
and he held a heavy rhinoceros hide whip
in his hand. Consul Carlson was over fifty.
Rosen was not over thirty, and appeared even
younger.</p>

<p>Count Rosen was talking while Mr. Carlson
listened with an unusual air of deference.</p>

<p>&#8220;When Kataafa was hurried here from
Malut, the island of his exile, our foreign
office expected you to have paved the way to
make him king.&#8221; The speaker struck a
picturesque stand in front of the consul&#8217;s
chair. &#8220;Instead you have been fraternizing
with these other consuls. The chief justice<span class="pagenum" id="Page_45">[45]</span>
has you under his thumb. Is that the way
to bring on a crisis?&#8221;</p>

<p>The Herzovinian consul swallowed a lump
in his throat. It was hard to be taken to task
by such a young man.</p>

<p>&#8220;Count Rosen,&#8221; he answered, a sudden
spark of resentment coming into his small
eyes, &#8220;if I have displeased the foreign office,
I can resign.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Resign,&#8221; the count exclaimed disgustedly.
&#8220;Why talk of resigning with such an opportunity
before you? Have you no ambition?
Will you permit Herzovinia to be robbed of
what naturally belongs to her? We have
worked long and spilled Herzovinian blood in
order to acquire these beautiful rich islands.
And with the end in sight will you resign?&#8221;</p>

<p>Mr. Carlson roused himself from his dejection.</p>

<p>&#8220;I agreed with the other consuls to try to
prevent a war. Cannot we succeed without
bloodshed? I don&#8217;t believe the foreign office
really wishes that.&#8221;</p>

<p>Count Rosen&#8217;s eyes flashed.</p>

<p>&#8220;What are these puny wars to our statesmen?&#8221;
he asked. &#8220;Has anything worth
while ever been attained without the shedding<span class="pagenum" id="Page_46">[46]</span>
of blood? But,&#8221; he added, &#8220;you were
about to tell me of some important news.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I have reliable information that a letter
has been received by Judge Lindsay, written
some years ago by our government, which demands
that Kataafa shall never be king,&#8221; Mr.
Carlson said earnestly. &#8220;I knew of the letter,
but believed it was withdrawn when England
and America refused to agree.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It was never withdrawn,&#8221; Count Rosen replied.
&#8220;The chief justice then will decide
for this foolish boy Panu-Mafili. That decision
must bring on a war.&#8221;</p>

<p>Mr. Carlson looked surprised, his round
red face a picture of timid anxiety. &#8220;Kataafa
will break his oath?&#8221; he questioned aghast.</p>

<p>&#8220;Of course, and now for the political side
of this issue,&#8221; the count nodded and continued.
&#8220;Under the treaty the three consuls
must act in concert to uphold the decisions of
the chief justice. Will you, knowing the aim
of your government and loving the natives as
your friends, give your support to such a
wicked decision? Will you call for your
sailors and force upon these honest, childlike
natives a king not of their choosing?&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_47">[47]</span>Mr. Carlson glanced up appealingly.
&#8220;Count,&#8221; he exclaimed, &#8220;what would you
do if you were in my place?&#8221;</p>

<p>Count Rosen smiled enigmatically. &#8220;Mr.
Carlson,&#8221; he replied, &#8220;I have no credentials.
I have been sent by our foreign office to study
the situation in the South Seas. At Fiji I received
a letter to go to Ukula. I am here.
Advice without responsibility is not good.
You must decide for yourself, for you alone
are responsible for your acts to our government.
I can, however, show you,&#8221; he added
earnestly, &#8220;how the situation will develop if
you continue to act in harmony with the
other consuls in upholding the decision, if it
is against Kataafa. The natives will arm and
fight. The Kataafa warriors are in vastly superior
numbers and will soon win a victory.
The sailors of three nations will be landed to
fight the victorious side. With their superior
guns and training many innocent natives
must be killed. It would then be a general
war, the whites against the natives.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;And if I refuse to stand with the others?&#8221;
the consul asked earnestly.</p>

<p>&#8220;That will greatly simplify everything,&#8221;<span class="pagenum" id="Page_48">[48]</span>
the count replied. &#8220;The Kataafa warriors
would declare him king. The Panu natives
in such great inferiority of numbers cannot
resist except with the aid of the sailors, and
that could not be given as long as you refuse
to join. The treaty distinctly stipulates that
action may be taken unanimously. There
would be no war. The next mail from home
would bring the recall of this partial judge.
Kataafa would remain king, and then he
must soon seek annexation to our Herzovinia.
I hope to see our flag hoisted over the Kapuan
Islands. And of course,&#8221; he added, &#8220;you
will get all the credit. The order of the
Black Eagle will be yours.&#8221;</p>

<p>The consul&#8217;s face was now fairly beaming
upon this kind prophet.</p>

<p>&#8220;My mind is made up,&#8221; he said. &#8220;I shall
refuse to be used by those who have only selfish
aims. I shall write and refuse to agree
with the other consuls.&#8221;</p>

<p>Count Rosen smiled triumphantly as he
rode his pony along the main road of Ukula.</p>

<p>&#8220;Carlson has been here too long,&#8221; he said
to himself. &#8220;He thinks there&#8217;s nothing beyond
his narrow horizon. His lonesome life<span class="pagenum" id="Page_49">[49]</span>
has made him timid; he needed stirring to
life. Herzovinia&#8217;s aims must be kept always
before us. Our statesmen decided years ago
to own these islands. Our money is invested
here and they are a link in our colonial chain.
A war! a little bloodshed! What does it matter?&#8221;</p>

<p>At the Kapuan firm&#8217;s store the count dismounted,
giving his pony in care of a native.</p>

<p>Klinger, the manager, met him at the door-step.
No word was spoken until they reached
the office in the rear of the store and the door
closed behind them.</p>

<p>&#8220;I see in your face you are successful,&#8221;
Klinger said as the count took the proffered
chair.</p>

<p>&#8220;Everything so far has been wonderful,&#8221;
the count exclaimed. &#8220;Judge Lindsay will
give the decision to Panu, Kataafa will revolt,
and Carlson will refuse to do anything. The
hands of our friends the enemy are tied.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I too have news,&#8221; Klinger said. &#8220;Kataafa
has bought all the guns coming in the &#8216;Talofa.&#8217;
Also he has answered Judge Lindsay&#8217;s letter,
that he cannot agree to give his word to remain
peaceful if the decision is against him,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_50">[50]</span>
as he considers the right to be king is his,
and he has already been acknowledged king
by one power. What do you think of that?&#8221;
he asked delightedly.</p>

<p>&#8220;I saw Kataafa to-day and he says he
is anxious for annexation to Herzovinia,&#8221;
Klinger continued. &#8220;The Americans, you
know, have acquired title to land in the harbor
of Tua-Tua on the island of Kulila. That
must be broken up.&#8221;</p>

<p>The count nodded. &#8220;Go ahead, you have
a free rein. And now what about the whereabouts
of our friend Captain &#8216;Bully&#8217; Scott?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I am looking for him daily,&#8221; Klinger replied.
&#8220;He is bringing enough guns to arm
every Kataafa warrior. All day long I have
been getting receipts from the natives for gun
to be delivered.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Always an eye for business,&#8221; the count
exclaimed in half jesting disgust. &#8220;You
merchants own these poor natives body and
soul.&#8221;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_51">[51]</span></p>
<div class="figcenter"><img src="images/i_050.jpg" alt="" /></div>
<p class="caption">THREE AMERICAN OFFICERS WERE STANDING IN THE ROAD</p>

<p>&#8220;What would you have us do?&#8221; Klinger
answered defensively. &#8220;I have spent many
thousands of dollars upon these rifles. I am
taking great risks in getting them here, for if
either of the war-ships seize them they will be
confiscated under the treaty, and I have no
redress. And, count,&#8221; he added, &#8220;you know
it is all for our country.&#8221;</p>

<p>Count Rosen nodded his head, but his steel
gray eyes looked squarely into those of the
manager of the Kapuan firm until the latter&#8217;s
fell in quick embarrassment. The count
knew that the man&#8217;s natural cupidity was a
large measure of the driving force stimulating
his patriotic enthusiasm.</p>

<p>&#8220;There&#8217;s nothing to do but wait,&#8221; the
count said as they reached the door of the
store.</p>

<p>Three American officers were standing in
the road at the front.</p>

<p>&#8220;The American commander will have to be
handled carefully,&#8221; the count said in a low
voice to Klinger, as he turned his back upon
the officers. &#8220;He&#8217;s a fine type; I can see it
in his face. He&#8217;d make a stanch friend, but
a difficult enemy.&#8221; This last to himself.
Sentiment was wasted upon the selfish manager
of a grasping firm.</p>

<p>&#8220;I must contrive to know him,&#8221; the count
added aloud.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_52">[52]</span>The American officers had now continued
along the road.</p>

<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t be too precipitate,&#8221; the count cautioned
as he whistled to the native boy, holding
his pony&#8217;s bridle.</p>

<p>The count mounted his pony, walking it
slowly down the road. At the Tivoli Hotel
he stopped and dismounted. Within a half
hour he walked from the hotel, carefully
dressed in a spotless white linen suit and helmet.
He turned his steps toward Matautu.</p>

<p>He turned in at the American consulate
gate, and walked with an air of high bred
assurance up the steps of the porch.</p>

<p>Mr. Lee arose to receive him, a frank smile
of cordiality upon his face.</p>

<p>&#8220;Count Felix Rosen.&#8221; The visitor pronounced
his name slowly; there was the
smallest of accents. &#8220;I have come to pay
my respects,&#8221; he said quietly. &#8220;We tourists
often forget our social duties.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It is I who should apologize, Count
Rosen,&#8221; Mr. Lee exclaimed, introducing the
visitor to his daughter and Commander
Tazewell. &#8220;You have been in Ukula for
several days, and I should have called<span class="pagenum" id="Page_53">[53]</span>
upon you and bid you welcome to our little
island.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Truly, sir, I should not expect you to take
so much trouble,&#8221; the count returned suavely.
&#8220;I am but a globe-trotter, as you say in
America. I have no aim, no business. I
go where I may be amused.&#8221;</p>

<p>The count accepted the cup of tea offered
him by Miss Lee and sipped it meditatively.
He felt the awkward silence and hastened to
relieve it.</p>

<p>&#8220;My time here is likely to be so short,&#8221; he
added, &#8220;that I hope if there must be war
among the natives they will wait until after I
can explore the islands. In my few days I
have ridden miles and have been everywhere
charmed with the natural beauty of the country
and the charming hospitality of the natives.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;We also, count, are hoping that there will
be no war,&#8221; Mr. Lee replied. &#8220;And if your
consul will stand with the British consul and
myself it can be averted.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;So!&#8221; the count exclaimed surprisedly.
&#8220;Does Mr. Carlson then desire a war? Sometimes
I lose all patience with my stubborn<span class="pagenum" id="Page_54">[54]</span>
countryman. It is very strange,&#8221; he added.
&#8220;I lunched with him to-day and he seemed
aggrieved that you and the British consul
would not support him to prevent a war.&#8221;</p>

<p>Commander Tazewell had been carefully
studying the speaker&#8217;s face. He read there
only disinterested amusement over the situation.
What business could this cultured
Herzovinian have with Klinger? He decided
to endeavor to find out.</p>

<p>&#8220;Most of the disturbances among the natives,&#8221;
Commander Tazewell said quietly,
&#8220;are brought about by the merchants. Arms,
you know, Count Rosen, are merchandise
upon which an enormous profit is realized.
A war, though, is required to create a market.
I believe that Mr. Klinger could allay your
uneasiness over the possibility of a war more
certainly than can either of the consuls.&#8221;</p>

<p>The count raised his eyes slowly to the
speaker&#8217;s face. Their eyes met and for a moment
each gauged the other. The count
shifted his gaze first; a faint suspicion of a
flush had come under his tanned cheeks.</p>

<p>&#8220;Klinger has been good enough to arrange
some trips for me into the interior of the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_55">[55]</span>
island,&#8221; the count explained quickly. &#8220;I
was arranging details with him for a trip
to the Papasea,<a id="FNanchor_10" href="#Footnote_10" class="fnanchor">[10]</a> the sliding rock, when you
passed his store.&#8221; A smile of delight spread
over his handsome face as he suddenly asked:
&#8220;Can&#8217;t we make up a party for that trip? I
should be charmed to play host. But,&#8221; he
added, &#8220;I suppose with you it is an old
story.&#8221;</p>

<p>Mr. Lee declined for himself. The uncertainty
of the situation demanded his continuous
presence in Ukula.</p>

<p>After some discussion it was arranged that
the party start the next morning. Alice and
the midshipmen returned in time to be included,
together with Commander Tazewell
and Miss Lee.</p>

<p>&#8220;I cannot express to you the honor you
have done me in accepting my invitation,&#8221;
the count exclaimed, as he bade good-bye.
&#8220;This morning I was a lonesome stranger,
and now I am rich in friends.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Who is he?&#8221; Commander Tazewell asked
the consul as his straight figure passed out of
sight down the road.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_56">[56]</span>Mr. Lee shook his head.</p>

<p>&#8220;Some well connected Herzovinian of the
smaller nobility, I suppose,&#8221; he replied. &#8220;His
consul called upon him almost at once after
he arrived on the last steamer from the South.
A title carries a great deal of dignity with it.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;He is certainly very fine looking,&#8221; Miss
Lee said admiringly.</p>

<p>&#8220;And knows how to talk,&#8221; Phil added.</p>

<p>&#8220;I believe he is a past master in the art of
talk,&#8221; Alice said pointedly. &#8220;And the worst
of it is we know what he says and not what
he means.&#8221;</p>

<p>All laughed at the girl&#8217;s quaint mode of
expression.</p>

<p>&#8220;Call me silly and a rebel all you please,&#8221;
she added turning upon her sister, who at
once denied even the thought of any such
accusation, &#8220;but I am and always will be suspicious
of a Herzovinian in Kapua. Anywhere
else he may be honest and mean what
he says, but here, no!&#8221; She shook her head
vigorously.</p>

<p>While the two midshipmen with Commander
Tazewell were returning in the captain&#8217;s
gig to the &#8220;Sitka,&#8221; Phil spoke of the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_57">[57]</span>
sailing vessel they had seen from Alice&#8217;s
&#8220;lookout.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Probably it isn&#8217;t Captain Scott&#8217;s &#8216;Talofa,&#8217;&#8221;
he added deprecatingly. &#8220;It was too far away
to see anything but the tops of her sails.&#8221;</p>

<p>Commander Tazewell listened earnestly.</p>

<p>&#8220;&#8216;Bully&#8217; Scott is usually on hand where
there is a chance for his nefarious trade in
guns,&#8221; he replied. &#8220;Miss Alice Lee may have
no real grounds for her belief that it is the
&#8216;Talofa,&#8217; but that young girl is more than
usually clever for one of her age, and her
father tells me she is worshiped by the native
women, to whom she is a veritable administering
angel. Tuamana&#8217;s daughter, Avao,
is her particular friend. You know,&#8221; he
added, &#8220;in Kapua, the women are the tale
bearers; no bit of interesting news escapes
them.&#8221;</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER IV<br />


<small>CAPTAIN &#8220;BULLY&#8221; SCOTT AND HIS MATE</small></h2>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">Captain &#8220;Bully&#8221; Scott</span> sat comfortably on
the combing of the after deck house and gazed
toward the high mountain ranges of the
islands of Kapua. The land had been in
sight all day, but the fitful breeze was hardly
enough to hold the &#8220;Talofa&#8217;s&#8221; great expanse
of canvas out taut against the sheets. Yet
even the light breeze drove the schooner
faster than the captain wished to travel.</p>

<p>&#8220;Bring her up another point,&#8221; he directed,
in a well modulated, almost cultivated voice.</p>

<p>The helmsman, a Fiji Islander, a strapping
bronze skinned native, naked except for the
loin cloth of tapa, eased down his helm until
the great sails flapped idly.</p>

<p>&#8220;Mr. Stump,&#8221; the captain called down the
hatch.</p>

<p>A middle-sized, wizened man stuck his head
up above the deck in answer.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_59">[59]</span>&#8220;Mr. Stump, I&#8217;ll thank you to invite our
passengers down to their staterooms and put
the hatch cover on and lock it,&#8221; Captain Scott
said politely. &#8220;It&#8217;ll be dark in another half
hour, and then we&#8217;ll &#8216;bear up&#8217; and run in to
close with the land.&#8221;</p>

<p>Benjamin Stump nodded his head in reply
and turned on his heel to go forward. This
was a daily occurrence. Captain Scott had
learned to secure his human cargo at night.
A mutiny that came near ending fatally to
him had taught him this lesson.</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, Stump!&#8221; Captain Scott raised his
voice to be heard above the lapping of the
water and the noise of shaking canvas. &#8220;I
hope our disagreement at Suva<a id="FNanchor_11" href="#Footnote_11" class="fnanchor">[11]</a> is all forgotten
by now. You can&#8217;t afford to fall out
with me, Stump,&#8221; he added menacingly after
the man had returned and lolled against the
shrouds of the main rigging. &#8220;There&#8217;s that
little affair at the Ellice Islands and the deal
in Tahiti; and besides, Stump, you know
that black boy on our last manifest didn&#8217;t
really fall overboard.&#8221;</p>

<p>Stump&#8217;s knees shook imperceptibly while<span class="pagenum" id="Page_60">[60]</span>
his thin claw-like fingers worked convulsively.
His uncouth mind had not forgotten
the matter. He had remembered it, lived
with the remembrance every day of the
thirty since leaving the Fijis; and had
nursed his desire for revenge against his
captain and benefactor.</p>

<p>&#8220;Captain Scott, you hadn&#8217;t any call to do
what you did,&#8221; he said doggedly. &#8220;Those
people were my friends, and righteous people
too. They believed the story I told &#8217;em.
They gave me human sympathy, and I was
downright sorry I wasn&#8217;t what I said I was.
I was afeared to tell them the truth. They
took me to prayer-meetings and prayed for
my soul and one of the young ladies begged
me to go home to my old parents and be forgiven.&#8221;</p>

<p>Captain Scott suddenly leaned back in his
seat and roared with uncontrolled laughter.</p>

<p>&#8220;You impious rascal!&#8221; he exclaimed.
&#8220;Do you suppose I could permit you to impose
upon my friends with any such tales?
I picked you up in Shanghai, do you remember?
You either had to go with me
or to the consular jail for being too light<span class="pagenum" id="Page_61">[61]</span>
fingered with other people&#8217;s money. You
told me your parents were dead; and besides,
that young lady was getting too sorry for you
for both her good and yours.&#8221;</p>

<p>Stump&#8217;s weasel eyes flashed angrily.</p>

<p>&#8220;You might have split on me differently,&#8221;
he said. &#8220;That girl&#8217;s accusing eyes hurt me
every time I think of it.&#8221;</p>

<p>Captain Scott stifled his merriment.</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m really sorry, Stump,&#8221; he said. &#8220;You
and I have been together a long time, and
sometimes maybe I don&#8217;t understand you as I
should. Sentiment is new to you. This trip
is going to give us a rich haul, and I&#8217;m going
to give you an extra hundred dollars just to
square your injured vanity.&#8221;</p>

<p>Captain Scott watched the lean figure as it
ambled forward. He saw him herd together
the score of black Solomon Islanders, brought
to sell into slavery on the plantations of the
Kapuan firm. After all had descended into
the dark stuffy forehold, Stump, with the
help of a couple of the Fiji crew, put on the
hatch cover and locked it. The only air for
the prisoners was admitted through two small
ventilators in the deck.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_62">[62]</span>&#8220;Stump&#8217;s acting queerly this trip,&#8221; Captain
Scott said thoughtfully to himself. &#8220;Appears
to be considering jumping the game. It won&#8217;t
do,&#8221; he exclaimed. &#8220;He knows too much
about yours truly. Nice gratitude, I call it,
after I saved him from a Chinese prison.&#8221;</p>

<p>Stump walked aimlessly aft and leaned indolently
against the rail. His face wore a
frown.</p>

<p>&#8220;What in blazes is the matter with you,
anyway?&#8221; Captain Scott exclaimed. &#8220;Your
face has been as long this trip as a Fiji
widow&#8217;s. You know me well enough by this
time to understand that sort of grump don&#8217;t
go with me. If you don&#8217;t cultivate a little
more pleasantry, I&#8217;ll have to dispense with
your company, no matter how necessary it
has been.&#8221;</p>

<p>Stump gained a measure of confidence in
the knowledge of war-ships in the harbor of
Ukula, not over twelve miles distant. The
very tops of their lofty spars could indistinctly
be seen against the dark green background
of the island.</p>

<p>&#8220;I have been considering cutting out this
here kind of life,&#8221; he replied. &#8220;That girl in<span class="pagenum" id="Page_63">[63]</span>
Suva made me hanker after going back to my
own folks. I haven&#8217;t heard of them for nearly
ten years.&#8221;</p>

<p>A sinister look came into Captain Scott&#8217;s cold
gray eyes. Stump was not only a useful man,
but he shared too many of the schooner&#8217;s dark
secrets. A way must be found to shake these
sentimental longings loose from Stump&#8217;s mind.</p>

<p>&#8220;Some day,&#8221; he returned suavely, &#8220;we&#8217;ll
make a trip with the &#8216;Talofa&#8217; up to &#8216;Frisco&#8217;
and turn over a new page in our life. You
are just down on your luck now, Stump,&#8221; he
added kindly. &#8220;That will all pass away
when you get ashore among your old cronies
on the beach at Ukula.&#8221;</p>

<p>In Stump&#8217;s mind a battle was being waged.
He was not naturally a bad man, but was
weak in character. He had run away from
home when he was only a lad, and the years
he had spent upon the sea had only brought
him lower in the human scale. Hard knocks
and brutality had been showered upon him.
He was by nature shiftless and lazy. No one
had ever taken the trouble to show him the
error of his ways. Captain Scott had used
him because he could bend him to his will.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_64">[64]</span>
The many unlawful acts he had committed
were at the instigation of his benefactor.
Stump was not a coward. He had proved
his fearlessness during many fights with the
savages of the black islands to the southward
where the &#8220;Talofa&#8221; had gone to steal the inhabitants
to sell them in the labor markets of
the South Seas. Captain Scott he did fear. He
feared his cold, calculating but nevertheless
diabolical temper, backed by a physical
strength almost superhuman. Ever since
leaving Suva, Stump had been brooding over
his misdeeds. Now he must finally make up
his mind. He wanted to get clear of the life
he now hated. He wanted to be free of the
fear of being arrested and put behind prison
bars. He wanted to part forever from the
man he so much feared. He was not entirely
ungrateful, nor did he harbor extreme revenge
against Captain Scott. Yet if he opposed him,
he must, to succeed, betray him into the
hands of the law even if by so doing he arrived
there himself.</p>

<p>After dark the &#8220;Talofa&#8221; was put under
more canvas and headed upon a compass
course set by the captain.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_65">[65]</span>An hour later Captain Scott and his mate,
Stump, stood again together near the wheel.
There were no lights except a dim lantern set
in a deck bucket.</p>

<p>&#8220;Stump,&#8221; the captain said pleasantly,
&#8220;how&#8217;d you like to be captain of the
&#8216;Talofa&#8217;?&#8221;</p>

<p>The mate glanced up in surprise.</p>

<p>&#8220;You&#8217;ll have to be taught navigation,&#8221; the
captain added. &#8220;That&#8217;s most all you need.
A little chart reading and practice in picking
your way among the reefs.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I navigated the &#8216;Pango&#8217; from the Ellice
Islands to Strong Island,&#8221; Stump reminded
him.</p>

<p>&#8220;So you did,&#8221; Captain Scott replied.</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, maybe you&#8217;ll do,&#8221; he added, after
a slight pause. He took the lantern out of
the bucket and held it over the chart of the
Kapuan Islands. Then he handed the lantern
to Stump.</p>

<p>&#8220;Hold this,&#8221; he directed, &#8220;and I&#8217;ll give
you a lesson in navigating.&#8221;</p>

<p>With parallel rulers, dividers and pencil,
the captain laid down a line from a position
he had made on the chart; then he transferred<span class="pagenum" id="Page_66">[66]</span>
the line with the parallel rulers to the
compass printed on the chart, and read the
compass direction of the line.</p>

<p>&#8220;There&#8217;s where I figured we were at dark,&#8221;
he said to the attentive Stump. &#8220;There&#8217;s the
entrance to the reef at Saluafata, and that&#8217;s
our compass course. Southeast, I make it.&#8221;
Then he stepped off the distance with the
dividers. &#8220;Fifteen miles it is.&#8221; He glanced
over the side and then up at the slack canvas.
&#8220;I guess we&#8217;re making about four knots, so
about eleven o&#8217;clock we should be hearing the
surf on the reef.&#8221;</p>

<p>Captain Scott took the lantern and again
placed it within the bucket.</p>

<p>&#8220;I reckon I can navigate,&#8221; Stump said to
himself. High hopes came into his mind,
and if Captain Scott could have read them he
would not have been so sure of winning back
Stump&#8217;s friendship. The mate&#8217;s thoughts had
at first been upon Suva, and his desire to
go back and square himself with the people
before whom Captain Scott had humiliated
him. Especially, Stump had wanted to tell
the young girl who had tried to make him a
better man that she had done him some good.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_67">[67]</span>
Once the captain of the &#8220;Talofa,&#8221; he could
try to be a better man. That in accepting
such a position in command of a vessel owned
by Captain Scott, he would be unable to cast
off his old life, did not occur to him. In fact
Stump did not consider as crimes the many
acts they had committed, and were committing.
To Stump a thing was a crime only
when the perpetrator was caught in the act
and put in jail. Stump knew that he owed
his immunity to Captain Scott. Once in
Suva without the captain, Stump thought
he could square himself with the girl, and
incidentally get even with Captain Scott.</p>

<p>As he took the lantern from Stump, Scott
held it up for an instant and observed his
mate&#8217;s face. What he saw there did not
seem to worry him. &#8220;I guess that offer will
keep his tongue quiet,&#8221; he mused. &#8220;With
an American war-ship in port, Stump&#8217;s apt to
meet some friends ashore and say too much.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Hold her on this course, Mr. Stump,&#8221; the
captain said officially. &#8220;I&#8217;m going to turn
in for forty winks. You can call me at ten
o&#8217;clock, and then get the crew all up on deck.&#8221;
Stump grunted and leaned over to look at the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_68">[68]</span>
compass. He saw the lubber&#8217;s point was on
the course the captain had figured out from
the chart. Captain Scott descended the ladder
to the cabin.</p>

<p>Stump suddenly took up the lantern and
placed it on the covered chart table. With
the dividers he measured off a distance on the
black line the captain had drawn and then
with the rulers he took off a course to another
point on the island.</p>

<p>&#8220;South by east,&#8221; he exclaimed in an undertone.
&#8220;Twelve miles to Ukula harbor. We
could do it in two hours at this speed.&#8221;
He glanced aloft. The canvas was drawing
well, the booms lying about three points on
the lee quarter. The wind was at east northeast.
The ship was heading southeast, and
therefore about two points &#8220;free.&#8221; South by
east would bring the wind one point abaft the
weather beam.</p>

<p>Stump, after satisfying himself of the feasibility
of his suddenly conceived plan, proceeded
to put it into execution. Picking his
way across the sleeping forms on the deck, he
made his way forward to the galley, where
the blacksmith&#8217;s forge was lashed. That day<span class="pagenum" id="Page_69">[69]</span>
he had been at work making a weld of wrought
steel to replace a spreader for the topmast
backstays. With this bar of steel in his hands,
he glanced into the galley. It was empty, but
the coffee kettle, still hot, was on the stove.
As he poured himself a cup, he ran over in
his mind the risk he was taking. His timid
soul quailed. Had he the courage to carry
through this bold plan of revenge? In the
harbor of Ukula Captain Scott had said was a
Yankee man-of-war. To bring the notorious
&#8220;Bully&#8221; Scott into the arms of the law, red
handed, with black boys and guns for the
natives, would be a stroke of diplomacy which
would bring fame to the name of Benjamin
Stump throughout all the South Sea Islands.
A better reward than the command of the
&#8220;Talofa&#8221;! Once Scott was behind the jail
bars, convicted of a felony, all his black career
would be told by those who would no longer
fear to tell the truth. The girl in Suva would
hear of it, and would believe her advice had
influenced him to bring to justice this sheep
in wolf&#8217;s clothing, the bold schemer who
made others do his evil work.</p>

<p>&#8220;Thinks I ain&#8217;t on to navigation,&#8221; he<span class="pagenum" id="Page_70">[70]</span>
chuckled. &#8220;Wasn&#8217;t in an iron war-ship for
nothing and helped the navigator to make
magnets out of steel bars to fix his compass.</p>

<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t owe him anything,&#8221; he added,
when his conscience troubled him as he remembered
how Captain Scott had paid his fine
at Shanghai. &#8220;He&#8217;s gotten his money&#8217;s worth
out of me, long ago. The score&#8217;s on my side
now. I&#8217;d rather go to jail anyway than to sail
with him longer. I swore I&#8217;d kill him when
I got a chance after he broke my arm with
that belaying-pin. He can&#8217;t prove nothing
against me; that Solomon Islander was accidentally
drowned, and the other things he
knows of&mdash;&mdash; Well, I&#8217;m sick of being
treated like a dog, and that&#8217;s the end of it.&#8221;</p>

<p>The warm coffee revived his waning courage,
and determinedly he started aft to the
wheel. He laid his steel bar against the rail
and took his stand behind the helmsman.</p>

<p>&#8220;There&#8217;s a pot of coffee on the galley,&#8221; he
said to Mata, the half-breed Fijian quartermaster.
&#8220;I&#8217;ll mind the wheel while you get
a cup.&#8221; He had no fear that the man would
refuse.</p>

<p>Mata turned over the wheel to Stump with<span class="pagenum" id="Page_71">[71]</span>
alacrity, and with a grunt of thanks disappeared
forward.</p>

<p>Now was his chance. He was not quite sure
that the plan would work. He did not understand
the science of magnetic attraction. He
was only following blindly what he had seen
the American naval officer do some years
before.</p>

<p>His frame trembling with nervous eagerness,
he eased the helm spoke by spoke. The
&#8220;Talofa&#8221; pitched and rolled more heavily as
her bow turned farther from the wind. Then
Stump was fearful lest the wind might be
shifting and might catch the sails aback and
jibe the heavy booms, thus carrying away the
sheets. At south by east he steadied. A
bright star almost directly ahead was just visible
along the line of the two masts. Disregarding
the compass he steered for the star,
taking a last glance at the compass. It still
read south by east. To reach out and secure
the bar of steel was accomplished in a second.
He put it alongside the binnacle. The compass
swung slowly away and came to rest
within a point of the old course. He raised
the bar and brought it closer against the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_72">[72]</span>
wooden binnacle. The course was within a
few degrees of the one the captain had set.
Releasing the helm for an instant he tied the
bar securely to the binnacle. The sails shivered
and the mainsail gave one loud flap that
brought Mata in sudden haste to his side.</p>

<p>&#8220;The breeze&#8217;s been hauling astern,&#8221; Stump
said, &#8220;and those booms are uneasy.&#8221;</p>

<p>Mata took the wheel. Glancing quickly
into the compass bowl, he saw the course was
correct.</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll ease off the sheets; it&#8217;ll make her lie
easy,&#8221; Stump explained, as he hurried away
to carry out his intention. He was filled with
joyous apprehension&mdash;joyful at the success
of his plan, but apprehensive that it would be
discovered. He eased off the main fore and
jib sheets until the sails were spanking full,
giving more speed, then he walked, with apparent
unconcern, back to the wheel.</p>

<p>&#8220;Getting in near the land, I reckon,&#8221; he
said. &#8220;Wind&#8217;s apt to blow different in there.&#8221;</p>

<p>Mata seemed puzzled, but his untrained
mind could not conceive that everything was
else but natural. A sudden change of wind
meant to him the approach of a storm, but the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_73">[73]</span>
sky showed no evidence, nor did the barometer
which he had read not an hour ago.</p>

<p>As near as Stump could figure the schooner
was now approaching Ukula harbor at a speed
of nearly six knots.</p>

<p>An hour passed. Then Stump grew restless.
Taking off his shoes he tiptoed down the companion
ladder to the cabin. All there was in
darkness. He listened. He could hear the
captain&#8217;s regular breathing. He was asleep.
Turning to steal back his foot encountered
an obstruction, and he fell heavily on the
deck.</p>

<p>&#8220;Is that you, Stump?&#8221; Captain Scott asked,
suddenly awaking. &#8220;Is it ten already?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;&#8217;Tain&#8217;t much past two bells,&#8221; Stump hastened
to answer. &#8220;Wind&#8217;s hauling to northward.
I was a-going to tell you if you were
awake.&#8221;</p>

<p>The captain grunted. Stump waited in
silence. No answer. The captain was again
asleep. Stump moved, this time more cautiously,
up the hatch.</p>

<p>The night was dark. The sky, brilliant with
stars, accentuated the shrouded deep. Undefined
shadowy shapes above the southern<span class="pagenum" id="Page_74">[74]</span>
horizon Stump knew to be the high mountain
range of the islands of Ukula.</p>

<p>Within an hour&#8217;s time lights made their appearance.
As time wore on more and more
lights sprang up from the sea. Stump, despite
the fear of his master&#8217;s vengeance, smiled
grimly. These lights were in the town of
Ukula and on board the anchored war-ships.
The &#8220;Talofa&#8221; was being drawn as by a loadstone
to its deserved retribution.</p>

<p>The lights came nearer. Stump glanced
anxiously at the clock inside the companion
hatch. The hands pointed to quarter past nine
o&#8217;clock. Now he thought he could hear the
thunder of the surf beating upon the reef.</p>

<p>Mata seemed wrapped in characteristic native
reserve. If he saw the lights ahead, he
considered them not his concern.</p>

<p>&#8220;Fishing on the reef at Saluafata,&#8221; Stump
said finally to relieve the tension on his own
nerves.</p>

<p>Mata gazed fixedly at the lights for nearly
a minute.</p>

<p>&#8220;Ukula,&#8221; he exclaimed, nodding his head
in that direction. &#8220;More better you speak
cap&#8217;n.&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_75">[75]</span>&#8220;It can&#8217;t be Ukula,&#8221; Stump exclaimed,
his voice feigning surprise at the suggestion.</p>

<p>&#8220;Big reef, plenty sharks. Cap&#8217;n Scott
smell the channel, you no can see.&#8221; Mata
gave his advice in short sentences.</p>

<p>As the &#8220;Talofa&#8221; approached, Stump&#8217;s nerve
began to fail him. To wreck the schooner
was more than he contemplated, yet if Mata
could recognize Ukula, Captain Scott surely
would at the first glance and defeat the plan.
To call Captain Scott now would end in putting
the schooner about and steering out to sea.
Stump then would have risked his captain&#8217;s
anger for no end. The would-be navigator
had been confident that he could find the
narrow entrance between the reefs, but with
the glare of lights in his eyes, his mind was
in utter bewilderment. He was in momentary
terror of hearing the roar of the surf
under the &#8220;Talofa&#8217;s&#8221; bow and the grinding
of her keel on the treacherous reef.</p>

<p>&#8220;Shark,&#8221; Mata exclaimed pointing to a
monster black fin, traveling along near at
hand to leeward of the schooner.</p>

<p>Stump was seized with a sudden wild panic.
His motor nerves became paralyzed. The<span class="pagenum" id="Page_76">[76]</span>
confusion of lights and the ever increasing
roar of the surf caused his knees to tremble
and his heart to almost stop beating. A voice
behind him, which a few minutes earlier would
have brought terror to his soul, now fell like
sweet music upon his ear.</p>

<p>&#8220;What&#8217;s the meaning of this, Mr. Stump?&#8221;
Captain Scott&#8217;s tone, though quiet, betrayed
great concern. &#8220;Shorten sail, sir!&#8221; he
shouted. &#8220;We must be nearly on the reef.&#8221;
Then of a sudden the situation dawned upon
Captain Scott. Stump was energetically kicking
the sleeping sailors to wakefulness, bawling
out his orders to &#8220;let go the gear&#8221; and
&#8220;man the down-hauls.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Great guns!&#8221; the captain cried aghast.
&#8220;It&#8217;s Ukula.&#8221;</p>

<p>Mata grunted an affirmative.</p>

<p>&#8220;Bear a hand there.&#8221; Captain Scott&#8217;s voice
could be heard above the thunder of flapping
canvas. &#8220;Douse everything. Get this speed
off her.&#8221; He glanced anxiously into the
compass; the schooner was on her course.</p>

<p>&#8220;Compass gone plumb crazy,&#8221; he exclaimed.
&#8220;You&#8217;ve got a jack-knife on!&#8221; He turned
savagely upon the helmsman, feeling for the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_77">[77]</span>
knife usually carried on a lanyard about the
waist, but Mata was not guilty of this great
nautical misdemeanor.</p>

<p>In but a few minutes the nimble crew had
gotten all sail off the schooner, yet the fresh
breeze still carried her toward the harbor.</p>

<p>&#8220;Mr. Stump, out on the bowsprit with
you,&#8221; the captain ordered. He himself had
gone to the forecastle, directing in his clear, far-reaching
voice the helmsman at the wheel aft.</p>

<p>A white, specter-like line suddenly appeared
close aboard, ahead and to starboard.</p>

<p>Captain Scott was now full master of the
situation. To the left of the line of breakers
was deep water.</p>

<p>&#8220;Starboard your helm,&#8221; he cried. Then,
&#8220;Steady so.&#8221; The &#8220;Talofa&#8217;s&#8221; bow was heading
between two long lines of surf, while ahead
were the lights of a large vessel, and between
her and the schooner, Captain Scott could see,
was deep water.</p>

<p>As they drew nearer the vessel took shape
out of the darkness.</p>

<p>&#8220;Ship ahoy,&#8221; a hoarse voice hailed the
&#8220;Talofa.&#8221;</p>

<p>Captain Scott purposely waited a repetition<span class="pagenum" id="Page_78">[78]</span>
of the challenge. He was thinking deeply.
The silhouette of the war-ship bore nearly
abeam. If he gave the schooner&#8217;s right name
he would stand a better chance of weathering
the visit from the war-ship which would be
made when he anchored. Subterfuge would
only lessen his chances. It had been too late
when he had come on deck to put the vessel
about and seek safety. The reef was too close
aboard. Now, once inside the harbor, to turn
and head out to sea would put his vessel
under suspicion, and a search-light in combination
with a few shells would bring him
back.</p>

<p>&#8220;The &#8216;Talofa&#8217; schooner from Fiji, Captain
Scott in command,&#8221; he answered, loud and
distinctly. &#8220;What ship is that?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;The United States Cruiser &#8216;Sitka,&#8217;&#8221; came
the answering hail.</p>

<p>The shrill notes of a boatswain&#8217;s pipe on
board the war-ship, followed by a deep
throated call and a hurry of shod feet, came
distinctly across the water.</p>

<p>The &#8220;Talofa&#8221; forged slowly ahead. Her
bow was swung to port as she nosed her way
into the inner harbor.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_79">[79]</span>&#8220;Let go the anchor,&#8221; Captain Scott cried
out disgustedly, and as the chain rattled out,
he quietly walked forward and directed the
sailor tending it to &#8220;haul to and secure.&#8221;
Then he called in Stump, still sitting inert on
the bowsprit end.</p>

<p>&#8220;A nice mess you&#8217;ve made of it,&#8221; he said
through shut jaws. Stump crawled in slowly,
stopping just out of arm&#8217;s reach. As agile as
a cat, Captain Scott suddenly cleared the distance
and his strong hand seized the shrinking
mate by the scruff of the neck. He shook
him until his bones rattled.</p>

<p>&#8220;Out with it,&#8221; he exclaimed. His voice to
Stump had the tone of rusty files. &#8220;How
did it happen? What did you do to the
compass?&#8221;</p>

<p>Stump saw no avenue of escape. The uncanniness
of Captain Scott&#8217;s intuition awed
him to his resolve for truthfulness.</p>

<p>&#8220;A boat&#8217;s alongside,&#8221; Stump sputtered as
his shifting and terrified gaze caught sight of
a shadowy form in the water making the side
of the schooner. The diversion was timely
for the trembling Stump. Captain Scott released
his hold, but the guilty mate, off his<span class="pagenum" id="Page_80">[80]</span>
guard, received the full force of Captain
Scott&#8217;s iron fist squarely under the jaws. His
body bent limply backward and fell heavily
upon the deck, where it lay motionless, while
Captain Scott strolled unconcernedly aft to
receive his visitors.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER V<br />


<small>THE &#8220;TALOFA&#8221; IN UKULA</small></h2>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">After</span> dinner all the officers of the &#8220;Sitka,&#8221;
as was the custom, took chairs upon the
quarter-deck. Phil and Sydney, having
finished their unpacking, had joined the
circle. The subject of conversation was the
course of local events. All looked forward
with ill concealed delight at the prospects of
active service.</p>

<p>&#8220;These natives are great fighters,&#8221; Ensign
Patterson exclaimed admiringly, &#8220;only they
don&#8217;t know the rules of the game. A few
hundred white men could hold their own
against as many thousand.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t bank too much on that argument
if you are lucky enough to command a company
of sailors ashore,&#8221; Lieutenant Sargeant
returned thoughtfully. &#8220;The Herzovinian
sailors some years ago were defeated and
many killed because their leader underrated<span class="pagenum" id="Page_82">[82]</span>
the soldierly ability of the Kapuan
warrior.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s certainly a travesty on our civilization.&#8221;
The doctor joined in the general conversation.
&#8220;Here are three war-ships, each
with a couple of hundred good rifle shots.
There are probably all told ten thousand
warriors in the islands. As far as I can learn,
two of these war-ships are pulling for Panu-Mafili
and one for Kataafa. If we all three
got together and told the natives to go peaceably
to their homes, and then if we proceeded
to quietly decide to agree upon something&mdash;well,
useless spilling of blood could be averted,
at any rate.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;The trouble with your argument is,
doctor,&#8221; Lieutenant Sargeant replied, &#8220;that
it&#8217;s too far up in the clouds. Remember
we&#8217;re all human and living on the earth
together. All three nations covet these
islands. Some day one will get them, so the
question is simply which?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Why should we be interested?&#8221; Phil inquired
modestly. &#8220;We have no trade here,
and but a handful of our countrymen live in
the islands.&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_83">[83]</span>&#8220;And most of them,&#8221; Lieutenant Sargeant
replied, &#8220;are people one cannot be proud to
acknowledge. But our real interest is to
get a coaling station here. Tua-Tua is a fine
land-locked harbor, and is on the steamer
route from both San Francisco and Panama
to New Zealand and Australia. Herzovinia
may have all the rest if we can hold the
island of Kulila with the harbor of Tua-Tua.
That&#8217;s why we have a war-ship here.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;What does England want out of it?&#8221;
Ensign Patterson inquired.</p>

<p>&#8220;England,&#8221; Lieutenant Sargeant answered,
&#8220;is interested to see that Herzovinia does not
grab too much. Through England&#8217;s help we
may be able to get Tua-Tua; without it,
against the Herzovinian diplomacy, we should
get nothing.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;The natives of Kapua stand to lose in any
case,&#8221; Sydney remarked. &#8220;I for one would
like to see the natives remain independent,
and hope that this will be the time when all
hands &#8216;bust&#8217; in their calculations.&#8221;</p>

<p>The captain of the British cruiser had been
paying a visit to Commander Tazewell, and
Phil, on duty as junior officer of the watch,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_84">[84]</span>
was called upon an hour later to see that the
English captain&#8217;s gig was manned for him at
the gangway.</p>

<p>The two commanders stood in the shadow
of the poop-deck conversing in low, serious
tones. Phil had found that the boat was
ready alongside and had advanced to report.
The figure of a man, also in the shadow, his
body bent forward in a listening attitude,
caught his eye. Phil stopped, and at once
the man drew back and walked silently
away. Phil crossed over to investigate the
identity of the evident eavesdropper. Suddenly
from the gloom of the deck the captain&#8217;s
orderly appeared.</p>

<p>&#8220;Were you looking for me, sir?&#8221; the sailor
said respectfully.</p>

<p>Phil hesitated. He was on the point of
denouncing him as an eavesdropper.</p>

<p>&#8220;I thought I heard you call, sir,&#8221; the sailor
added apologetically. &#8220;I was on a message
forward for the captain.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, report to the captain that the
English gig is at the gangway,&#8221; Phil ordered.
The midshipman decided he had confronted
the wrong man. &#8220;Did you pass any<span class="pagenum" id="Page_85">[85]</span>
one as you came aft?&#8221; he asked as an afterthought.</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, sir,&#8221; the orderly replied readily.
&#8220;Just there a man passed going forward. I
took him for one of the electrical gang. He
came out of the cabin, I think.&#8221;</p>

<p>The orderly crossed the deck, saluted stiffly
and made his report. The two captains
walked slowly toward the gangway. Phil
took his place to the left of the regular officer
of the deck.</p>

<p>&#8220;Good-night,&#8221; the Englishman said, his
hand to his cap. &#8220;You&#8217;ll find us ready when
you say the word, Tazewell,&#8221; he added in a
loud aside as he briskly descended the ladder
to his boat.</p>

<p>Phil hesitated whether to tell the captain
of his suspicions. The man might have been
an electrician, as the orderly had said. Phil
crossed over to the exact spot where he had
seen the man stand and tried to strike the
same attitude. An electric globe light fixture
was above his head, but it was not lighted.
He reached up and turned the switch. The
light did not burn. That was why the deck
there was in shadow. The man must have<span class="pagenum" id="Page_86">[86]</span>
been an electrician who was examining the
fixture. The thing was so simple that Phil
tried to dismiss the incident from his mind.</p>

<p>&#8220;What is that orderly&#8217;s name?&#8221; he asked
of the boatswain&#8217;s mate of the watch.</p>

<p>&#8220;Schultz,&#8221; Boatswain&#8217;s Mate O&#8217;Neil replied.
&#8220;He&#8217;s a &#8216;sea-lawyer&#8217;<a id="FNanchor_12" href="#Footnote_12" class="fnanchor">[12]</a> too, Mr. Perry. Ain&#8217;t
worth his ration of &#8216;salt-horse&#8217;<a id="FNanchor_13" href="#Footnote_13" class="fnanchor">[13]</a> either.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Then why does the captain keep him as
his orderly?&#8221; Phil asked.</p>

<p>&#8220;Search me, sir, except he&#8217;s a good parrot
for messages,&#8221; O&#8217;Neil suggested. &#8220;An orderly,
you know, sir, hasn&#8217;t any use for brains. He&#8217;s
just telegraph wire.&#8221;</p>

<p>Phil smiled at O&#8217;Neil&#8217;s analogy.</p>

<p>&#8220;Schultz,&#8221; he thought. &#8220;I&#8217;d feel surer
that it wasn&#8217;t he if his name had suggested
some other nationality. But then there are a
lot of such names in our navy.&#8221;</p>

<p>Other and more stirring incidents drove
Schultz from Phil&#8217;s mind.</p>

<p>Phil and the officer of the deck, Lieutenant
Morrison, were pacing the quarter-deck scarcely
twenty minutes later. The older officer was
one to whom the midshipman had immediately<span class="pagenum" id="Page_87">[87]</span>
taken a great fancy. He was a man of strong
character and even temper, and probably ten
years the lad&#8217;s senior in both age and experience.</p>

<p>&#8220;It looks as if the Kapuan volcano were
going to erupt again, Mr. Perry,&#8221; he said in
his quiet, thoughtful way. &#8220;There&#8217;s been
peace among the natives for nearly five years,
and they are in prime condition to be stirred
into a war. The triple government has succeeded
under a strong native king. The dead
monarch, Laupepe, was really a highly educated
savage. Now there is only one native
with sufficient influence to avert a war, and
he is too partial to Herzovinia to be acceptable
to either our country or England. You know
we have our eye on Tua-Tua as a coaling station,
and if Kataafa becomes king our opportunity
of acquiring that harbor will vanish in
smoke.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Do you believe there will be a war?&#8221;
Phil asked eagerly. &#8220;Will the sailors be
landed to fight against the natives?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s been done before,&#8221; Lieutenant Morrison
replied. &#8220;It really seems a heartless
thing to do, but that is the only means of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_88">[88]</span>
enforcing your will on a savage. Force is the
only argument he understands. Kataafa has
established his government at Kulinuu Point,
you know, and sent out word to all the islands
for his adherents to gather. It&#8217;s unlikely that
he will give in peaceably if the chief justice&#8217;s
decision is against him. Of course it is no
secret who is supporting him in his attitude.
The Kapuan firm under Klinger is his
banker.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;There&#8217;s a sailing vessel just beyond the
breakers, sir,&#8221; the quartermaster on watch
reported from the after bridge. &#8220;She&#8217;s not
carrying lights and seems to be heading for
the entrance.&#8221;</p>

<p>Both officers strained their eyes in an endeavor
to make out more plainly a dim shape
which the quartermaster&#8217;s trained eyes had
discovered. Phil&#8217;s thoughts went back at
once to the schooner seen from Alice&#8217;s Mission
Hill, far out on the ocean.</p>

<p>&#8220;Only a trading schooner,&#8221; Lieutenant
Morrison pronounced as he focussed his night
binoculars upon the ill-defined silhouette of a
large schooner under full canvas. &#8220;By George,
she&#8217;s coming through in yachtsman&#8217;s style.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_89">[89]</span>
Not a sheet started, in a stiff breeze too, and
not five hundred yards from the reef.</p>

<p>&#8220;There! She shortens sail,&#8221; he exclaimed
admiringly. &#8220;Her skipper knows the harbor,
that&#8217;s certain, or he wouldn&#8217;t be taking such
chances.&#8221;</p>

<p>The sailing vessel was plainly seen to take
in all her sails almost at the same time, and
the next minute she was in the narrow channel
between the barrier reefs upon which the
sea was breaking heavily.</p>

<p>&#8220;Can it be the &#8216;Talofa&#8217;?&#8221; Phil asked excitedly.
&#8220;Captain &#8216;Bully&#8217; Scott&#8217;s ship?&#8221;</p>

<p>Lieutenant Morrison had sent word to the
captain of the arrival of a strange sail, and now
he waited her nearer approach to &#8220;hail&#8221; her.</p>

<p>Twice the lieutenant&#8217;s hail of inquiry was
ignored. The schooner was now abreast, her
speed materially decreased, yet still traveling
smartly through the water.</p>

<p>&#8220;The &#8216;Talofa&#8217; schooner from Fiji, Captain
Scott in command.&#8221; The answer was bold and
distinct.</p>

<p>&#8220;By Jove! How did you guess it?&#8221; the
lieutenant exclaimed. Then he answered the
&#8220;Talofa&#8217;s&#8221; inquiry.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_90">[90]</span>Commander Tazewell had come up from
below and stood at the side of the officer of
the deck.</p>

<p>&#8220;Let Mr. Perry board her,&#8221; he ordered
quietly, and as the officer of the deck moved
away to give the boatswain&#8217;s mate the order
to call away the running boat, Commander
Tazewell gave Phil some instructions as to
his conduct to the captain of the merchant
ship.</p>

<p>&#8220;Scott disclaims American nationality,&#8221; he
said. &#8220;I hear he now flies the Herzovinian
flag. You must go on board under the impression
that he is an American and therefore
under the control of our consul while in the
harbor. Ask him of what his cargo consists.
I must leave the rest to your good judgment.&#8221;</p>

<p>Commander Tazewell waited until he heard
the rattle of anchor chain as the schooner
anchored, then returned to his cabin, while
Phil took command of the boat.</p>

<p>&#8220;To the schooner,&#8221; he said, turning to the
sailor in the coxswain&#8217;s box. &#8220;Is that you,
O&#8217;Neil?&#8221; he exclaimed in some surprise.</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, sir. I happened to be handy, so Mr.
Morrison told me to get in. The regular coxswain<span class="pagenum" id="Page_91">[91]</span>
wasn&#8217;t on deck,&#8221; O&#8217;Neil replied. &#8220;I&#8217;ve
been hearing of this fellow &#8216;Bully&#8217; Scott
ashore. All the natives say he&#8217;s bringing
arms for the Kapuan firm, to be sold to
Kataafa. These natives are like women; they
can&#8217;t keep secrets; it ain&#8217;t in them.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Why does he come into Ukula, then?&#8221;
Phil asked.</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, that&#8217;s like &#8216;Bully&#8217; Scott. He could
have taken them anywhere else, but he enjoys
doing something unexpected,&#8221; O&#8217;Neil
answered admiringly.</p>

<p>&#8220;He has probably then already landed his
guns,&#8221; Phil said, disappointedly. &#8220;Of course,
that&#8217;s the explanation. His guilty cargo is
no longer on board to convict him.&#8221;</p>

<p>O&#8217;Neil steered the boat alongside the
schooner&#8217;s sea ladder, and Phil swung himself
over the low rail. Everything was in
darkness around him.</p>

<p>&#8220;Bring that lantern here, you lazy black
rascal,&#8221; a big, hearty voice called, and from
the darkness Phil saw take shape a figure
that he could have avowed to be that of a
Puritan father or a missionary bishop. A
tall man, elderly, dressed in dark clothes, a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_92">[92]</span>
flowing gray beard sweeping his expansive
chest. The lantern, brought quickly by the
&#8220;black rascal,&#8221; showed a handsome and benevolent
countenance.</p>

<p>&#8220;I am delighted to see you, sir,&#8221; he said
courteously and in a voice so refined as to
fairly startle Phil.</p>

<p>&#8220;Are you the captain?&#8221; the lad stammered,
as he accepted the proffered hand.</p>

<p>&#8220;At your service, sir. Captain &#8216;Bully&#8217;
Scott is the name by which I&#8217;m known in
these waters.&#8221;</p>

<p>Phil took a firmer grip upon himself. How
much easier he would have found his task if
Captain Scott had been in appearance the
pirate he had pictured him.</p>

<p>&#8220;My captain, Commander Tazewell, of the
cruiser &#8216;Sitka,&#8217; sends his compliments and
wishes a little information. The usual boarding
information, you know.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Walk aft, sir,&#8221; Captain Scott requested
politely. &#8220;You are welcome to the information,&#8221;
he continued as he placed the lantern
on the deck table between them, &#8220;but I take
it, Commander Tazewell supposed my ship
was sailing under American colors.&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_93">[93]</span>Phil hesitated how to reply. The benevolent
eyes were upon him.</p>

<p>&#8220;I can&#8217;t say as to that,&#8221; the lad replied
slowly, &#8220;but the general impression I got was
that you were an American citizen.&#8221;</p>

<p>The lantern shed a dim light over the narrow
deck space. The native sailors were
busily furling the massive sails. Phil heard
the rhythmical sound of oars in their rowlocks;
other boats were approaching the
&#8220;Talofa.&#8221; He heard the scraping of a boat
alongside and the heavy breathing of a man
climbing up the ship&#8217;s side. Captain Scott had
left the midshipman to investigate the new arrivals.
He had made as yet no reply to the
young officer&#8217;s insinuating remark.</p>

<p>&#8220;Why on earth did you enter the harbor?&#8221;
he heard the newcomer exclaim as he swung
his leg over the rail. Phil recognized the decidedly
foreign accents of Klinger&#8217;s voice.</p>

<p>&#8220;Aha!&#8221; Phil thought. &#8220;Not so innocent
after all.&#8221;</p>

<p>Scott answered the question in a strange
tongue, and Phil saw Klinger glance quickly
in his direction.</p>

<p>Phil&#8217;s eye as he attentively listened had<span class="pagenum" id="Page_94">[94]</span>
been fixed upon the compass binnacle near
him. He noted a bar of iron jammed closely
against it and apparently tied in that position.</p>

<p>&#8220;Queer manner of correcting a compass,&#8221;
he thought.</p>

<p>The two men at the gangway continued to
talk. Phil recognized the language to be
Kapuan, of which he could not understand a
word.</p>

<p>&#8220;To-morrow morning, then, I shall be
ashore,&#8221; Captain Scott said finally in English.
&#8220;When will my cargo be ready?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s ready now at the plantations,&#8221; Klinger
answered also in English. &#8220;You&#8217;ve got to go
for it.&#8221; Then he lapsed again into Kapuan.
After a few more minutes the man again
climbed down the schooner&#8217;s side and into his
boat, then Captain Scott walked aft to join
Phil, while Klinger&#8217;s boat pulled swiftly toward
the shore.</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m under contract with the Kapuan firm,&#8221;
Captain Scott said pleasantly. &#8220;That was the
manager, Klinger. He is a very disagreeable
fellow, and I shall be glad to finish my business
with him and be off.&#8221;</p>

<p>Phil saw there could be nothing further<span class="pagenum" id="Page_95">[95]</span>
learned from Captain Scott, yet he was firmly
convinced from Klinger&#8217;s remark that something
had miscarried. There were a number
of questions, however, usual in boarding an
arriving vessel, which he proceeded to ask the
captain.</p>

<p>&#8220;Under what flag are you sailing?&#8221; Phil
inquired.</p>

<p>&#8220;Herzovinian,&#8221; Captain Scott replied
readily.</p>

<p>&#8220;You have no contraband on board?&#8221; the
midshipman asked suddenly, his eyes riveted
upon the sea-captain&#8217;s face.</p>

<p>Captain Scott&#8217;s benign smile returned.</p>

<p>&#8220;Young man, there&#8217;s no longer any profit
in firearms.&mdash;Is that why your captain was so
prompt to send his officer aboard?&#8221; he asked,
laughing as if he enjoyed the joke immensely.
&#8220;And besides, with the entire island available
for a vessel of the &#8216;Talofa&#8217;s&#8217; draft, Captain
Scott would not be likely to sail into Ukula
with a cargo of arms; not while there are three
consuls ashore, and as many war-ships at anchor
in the harbor. My cargo consists of cotton
cloth and canned stuffs for the &#8216;firm,&#8217; and I
return to Fiji with a load of &#8216;copra.&#8217;&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_96">[96]</span>&#8220;What is that bar of iron alongside the
compass?&#8221; Phil asked curiously. He was
firmly convinced that Klinger and Captain
Scott were partners in some unlawful trade,
but for the life of him could not see how he could
drag from this benevolent host, albeit pirate
and smuggler, information upon which action
could be taken.</p>

<p>Captain Scott eyed the bar of steel. Phil
thought he discerned a slight start, at least a
hesitancy in his manner.</p>

<p>&#8220;That,&#8221; the captain replied, &#8220;is one of my
mate&#8217;s clever ideas in correcting the compass.
I don&#8217;t know where he learned it, but it seems
very effective.&#8221;</p>

<p>Phil called to his boat, thanked Captain
Scott, and was soon returning to the
&#8220;Sitka.&#8221;</p>

<p>After he had gone Captain Scott tore the
steel bar savagely from the compass. Then he
walked forward to the forecastle. His sailors
had about finished stowing the sails.</p>

<p>&#8220;Stump,&#8221; he called. He glanced about the
deck. There was no one there. He picked
up his mate&#8217;s hat from the spot where the man
had fallen under the blow from Captain Scott&#8217;s<span class="pagenum" id="Page_97">[97]</span>
fist. He turned toward several natives who
were on the point of going below, their work
finished.</p>

<p>&#8220;Find Mr. Stump,&#8221; he ordered anxiously.
&#8220;Look for him at once.&#8221; He himself hurried
about the ship, seeking him in every dark
corner; but Stump could not be found.</p>

<p>&#8220;The ungrateful dog!&#8221; he cried in a fearful
rage. Captain &#8220;Bully&#8221; Scott now showed his
true colors. He raved and stormed. The natives
cowered away from him. The steel bar in his
hand was waved above his head menacingly.</p>

<p>&#8220;If I ever get him on board here again I&#8217;ll
smash him into an unrecognizable blot on the
deck,&#8221; he raved. &#8220;He&#8217;s gone! He brought
the &#8216;Talofa&#8217; into Ukula with this bar of steel!
He&#8217;s probably boasting at this minute how he
did it.&#8221; He shook his fist at the war-ship,
whose lights blazed brightly several hundred
yards away. &#8220;It&#8217;s a race with &#8216;Bully&#8217; Scott,&#8221;
he exclaimed. &#8220;You think you have me
cornered. To-morrow, or even to-night, you
will have the story from my sneaking mate.
Then you will search and discover the arms;
but I&#8217;ll fool you yet.&#8221;</p>

<p>A swiftly propelled boat swung up alongside<span class="pagenum" id="Page_98">[98]</span>
the schooner. A tall man swung himself
with no apparent muscular effort over the
rail and stood in the darkness seeking some
one on the schooner.</p>

<p>Captain Scott, still beside himself with
rage, spied the newcomer. His rage subsided.
Again the benevolent expression returned to
his face while a native quickly brought forward
the lantern and revealed the face of
Count Rosen.</p>

<p>&#8220;Has the American officer gone?&#8221; the
count asked hastily, glancing covertly around.</p>

<p>Captain Scott nodded. &#8220;Asked if I had
contraband and seemed satisfied when I told
him if I had I should hardly have brought
them into Ukula when there were other ports
in the island free and open.&#8221;</p>

<p>The count&#8217;s face showed perplexity. Was
this American merchant captain deceiving
him and Klinger? &#8220;Why did you come into
Ukula?&#8221; he asked.</p>

<p>Captain Scott chuckled. &#8220;A little stratagem,
count. You see, Klinger wrote to go to
Saluafata, but the &#8216;Talofa&#8217; preferred Ukula.
We have until daylight to land our cargo.
The war-ship will not think we can do anything<span class="pagenum" id="Page_99">[99]</span>
before morning. I told Klinger to send
over his barges quietly at once.&#8221;</p>

<p>The count was not satisfied. He did not
share the optimism of Captain Scott.</p>

<p>With a curt bow he returned to his boat
and swiftly rowed toward the Herzovinian
cruiser. As he stepped upon the deck, an
officer and several sailors of the watch met
him. They saluted with deep respect.</p>

<p>&#8220;I wish to see your captain upon important
business,&#8221; he announced. He was conducted
at once to the cabin.</p>

<p>He remained in consultation only a few
minutes. When he returned accompanied by
the captain, a war-ship&#8217;s boat was manned, a
young officer in command. Count Rosen
bowed graciously to the attentive captain and
entered the boat, sending ashore his own after
paying the helmsman liberally.</p>

<p>The boat pulled close under the bows
of the American cruiser, on its way to the
schooner. The count noticed a war-ship&#8217;s
boat ready manned at the gangway. From
the schooner came faint sounds of men
laboring. They had already begun to open
the hatches.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_100">[100]</span>Half-way to the schooner a noise as of a
swimmer caught the count&#8217;s attentive ear.</p>

<p>&#8220;What is that?&#8221; he asked the young
officer. At the word of command the men
stopped rowing. Scarcely fifty yards away
appeared a man&#8217;s head; he was making rather
feeble progress through the water. The boat
was quickly brought alongside the swimmer
and the man hauled on board.</p>

<p>A lantern was held up to his face. It was
pale and haggard. The man was almost
exhausted. The count noticed that the
swimmer&#8217;s face was much swollen and discolored,
as if from a blow. Even in the
tropical air his teeth chattered and speech
was nearly impossible. The count took off
his own cape and wrapped it about the trembling
figure. Then the boat pulled for the
schooner, several hundred yards away.</p>

<p>The officer and three men scrambled on
board. Two small lighters were lying alongside
the &#8220;Talofa,&#8221; and a score of &#8220;blacks&#8221;
were making ready to discharge her cargo.</p>

<p>The count asked a hurried question. The
young officer in his party saluted and answered
in the affirmative, pointing to a bundle<span class="pagenum" id="Page_101">[101]</span>
under his arm. The boat waited until a fluttering
flag rose slowly to the peak of the main
gaff. It was too dark to distinguish the
markings, but the count knew that the situation
had been saved. The &#8220;Talofa&#8221; was
under the protection of his navy&#8217;s flag.</p>

<p>The count had hardly cleared the gangway
before the &#8220;Sitka&#8217;s&#8221; boat rounded to under
the schooner&#8217;s stern and shot alongside.</p>

<p>&#8220;If Captain Scott has sold out to his
countrymen,&#8221; the count exclaimed to himself,
&#8220;he will find it difficult to deliver the
goods.&#8221;</p>

<p>At the dock he alighted. The rescued man
was supported up to the hotel between two
sailors.</p>

<p>Dry clothes were provided him and from
his medicine chest the count administered a
sleeping draught. Once snugly wrapped in
blankets in one of the rooms of the count&#8217;s
suite, and a native boy sleeping across the
only exit, the count felt sure that the stranger
would be on hand in the morning to explain
the mystery of why a white man was swimming
from the &#8220;Talofa&#8221; toward the &#8220;Sitka,&#8221;
his face bruised and himself half exhausted.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_102">[102]</span>
It would be worth all the trouble he had taken
to know.</p>

<p>The count yawned. It was nearly midnight,
and in the tropics one must be an early riser,
for the heat of the morning sun does not conduce
to refreshing sleep. He dismissed the
sailors who had aided him. Then he shut
his door and threw himself down on his couch
to think.</p>

<p>After several minutes, he rose and penned
two notes. Sealing them, he called one of the
attendant natives.</p>

<p>&#8220;Take this one at once,&#8221; he directed; &#8220;the
other,&#8221; he added to himself, &#8220;can wait until
early to-morrow morning.&#8221;</p>

<p>The native bowed and disappeared upon his
errand.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER VI<br />


<small>THE &#8220;TALOFA&#8217;S&#8221; CARGO</small></h2>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">Phil,</span> upon his return to the &#8220;Sitka,&#8221; recounted
to his captain everything that had
occurred during his visit to the suspected
schooner.</p>

<p>&#8220;I am confident, sir,&#8221; he ended, &#8220;that
Captain Scott has arms on board, and further,
that Klinger is in much concern that he has
brought them openly to this harbor when he
might have landed them elsewhere.&#8221;</p>

<p>Commander Tazewell commended the midshipman
for his energy. &#8220;It&#8217;s a difficult question
to settle,&#8221; he said. &#8220;I have no proof of
Scott&#8217;s nationality. He was born in San
Francisco, they say, of Irish-Scotch parents.
He has no right to sail under the Herzovinian
flag unless his vessel is owned by people of
that nation or he himself is a subject of that
country.&#8221;</p>

<p>The commander paced his cabin for several<span class="pagenum" id="Page_104">[104]</span>
minutes thoughtfully in silence. Upon
his shoulders great responsibilities rested.
Every act must be carefully considered.
Where other nations were so intimately concerned,
especially in the irritable political
atmosphere of Kapua, where every white
man&#8217;s hand seemed against his white neighbor
and the poor, innocent native is but the instrument
upon which the selfish desires are to
be perpetrated, ill judged acts had best be
avoided.</p>

<p>&#8220;I can&#8217;t see that we can do more now, Mr.
Perry,&#8221; he added in finality. &#8220;I shall have
the officer of the deck keep his weather eye on
the &#8216;Talofa&#8217; during the night.&#8221;</p>

<p>As Phil rejoined the officer of the deck, six
bells were striking. The &#8220;Talofa&#8221; was in
darkness except for her single anchor stay
light. The night was quiet. The sea breeze
had decreased in force.</p>

<p>It was not long before the watchers on the
American war-ship discovered that the two
canoe shaped barges of the Kapuan firm were
being poled out toward the anchored schooner.
When this was surely noted and reported to
the captain, he ordered the boat be held ready<span class="pagenum" id="Page_105">[105]</span>
and for Phil to stand by to return and investigate.</p>

<p>&#8220;Probably getting ready for the morning,&#8221;
Lieutenant Morrison suggested.</p>

<p>&#8220;If there are arms there,&#8221; Phil replied,
&#8220;and I am inclined to think there must be,
Captain Scott will either try to unload to-night
or else he will leave them in his holds
until he arrives at a safer place.&#8221;</p>

<p>Faint sounds of creaking tackles and the
noise of opening hatches came across the
intervening water.</p>

<p>&#8220;They are going to unload to-night,&#8221; Phil
exclaimed. &#8220;What a splendid nerve that
fellow Captain Scott must have.&#8221;</p>

<p>The startling news brought Commander
Tazewell on deck.</p>

<p>&#8220;Have the gig manned,&#8221; he ordered quietly,
&#8220;and let Mr. Perry take the whale-boat and
investigate what is going forward there. I
must break the ice between us and the Herzovinian
commander. I cannot stand idly by
and see such an outrage committed.&#8221;</p>

<p>Once more, with O&#8217;Neil in the coxswain&#8217;s
box, Phil was heading for the &#8220;Talofa.&#8221; He
had barely cleared the &#8220;Sitka&#8217;s&#8221; side when<span class="pagenum" id="Page_106">[106]</span>
another boat came out of the darkness ahead,
crossed the whale-boat&#8217;s bow and sheered
alongside the schooner.</p>

<p>&#8220;From the Herzovinian war-ship,&#8221; O&#8217;Neil
exclaimed.</p>

<p>Phil&#8217;s pulse quickened. The situation was
growing acute.</p>

<p>&#8220;If it comes to a fight,&#8221; he said excitedly,
&#8220;we are two to one,&#8221; pointing in the direction
of the British cruiser, &#8220;but a fight here would
plunge three great nations into war.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s only a bluff, sir,&#8221; O&#8217;Neil sized up the
situation sagely. &#8220;Those fellows are the
cleverest dodgers you ever laid eyes on.
They can fight all right, there&#8217;s no denying
that fact, but their cleverest dodge is to play
politics. I&#8217;ve seen them do it against the
&#8216;chinks&#8217; in China, and against the dagos in
South America. When a Herzovinian officer
goes too far the king with his right hand
gives him a hook in the solar plexus, and
then, to soften the medicine, with his left
hangs the order of the red tailed eagle around
his neck.&#8221;</p>

<p>Phil laughed nervously. &#8220;What do we do
to our officers who overstep the bounds of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_107">[107]</span>
international etiquette?&#8221; he asked, thinking
of the predicament in which Commander
Tazewell found himself suddenly involved.</p>

<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s easy to answer, sir,&#8221; O&#8217;Neil replied
readily enough. &#8220;He gets the solar plexus
blow from the man at the &#8216;top,&#8217; and unless
he&#8217;s popular with a few big newspaper editors,
usually dies an official death. Now Admiral
Benham, when he belayed that revolution in
Brazil some years ago, was on the point of
getting the &#8216;hook,&#8217; when a friend of his gave
him a great &#8216;pipe off&#8217; in the New York papers.
He made the admiral a Farragut and an
Abraham Lincoln spliced together. The
&#8216;hook&#8217; was quietly stowed away for future
use.&#8221;</p>

<p>As the &#8220;Sitka&#8217;s&#8221; whale-boat was steered
alongside, the foreign boat shoved off. Phil
peered eagerly through the darkness. He saw
an erect figure in white in the stern sheets.</p>

<p>&#8220;Looks for all the world like that Herzovinian
count,&#8221; he exclaimed excitedly.
O&#8217;Neil strained his eyes to see, but the boat
was rapidly being swallowed into the night.</p>

<p>Phil noted the two big cargo canoes alongside
the schooner, while he saw a score or more<span class="pagenum" id="Page_108">[108]</span>
of figures moving about on the deck above
him. He was on the point of climbing the
ladder when a voice from above in broken
English called to him to halt.</p>

<p>&#8220;No one is permit to enter,&#8221; the man said.
Phil saw that it was a Herzovinian sailor.</p>

<p>&#8220;I would like to speak to your officer, if
there is one there,&#8221; Phil said haughtily.</p>

<p>&#8220;What do you want?&#8221; was asked gruffly.
&#8220;This vessel is chartered by the Herzovinian
government, and it is not permitted to
visit.&#8221;</p>

<p>Phil&#8217;s anger blazed into flame. For the
fraction of a second he was on the point of
leading his men up to forcibly capture the
schooner, but the cool, restraining hand of
O&#8217;Neil, an old friend frequently encountered
by this impetuous youth, brought second
thoughts to ward off a rash act.</p>

<p>&#8220;Steady, sir,&#8221; O&#8217;Neil whispered. &#8220;There&#8217;s
a big flag flapping up there. Can&#8217;t tell for
sure, but I can guess that it&#8217;s the man-of-war
flag. We&#8217;ve made them show their hand;
don&#8217;t spoil it by getting yourself in trouble.&#8221;</p>

<p>Phil sank back into the boat. His foot
had been on the lower rung of the sea ladder.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_109">[109]</span>&#8220;May I inquire what you are unloading?&#8221;
he asked.</p>

<p>There were indistinct whispers from above.</p>

<p>&#8220;Furniture for our consulate,&#8221; came the
answer after some delay.</p>

<p>&#8220;You are not unloading guns for Kataafa,
then?&#8221; Phil retorted angrily.</p>

<p>There was no reply. The sailor continued
to block the rail above where Phil was standing.</p>

<p>&#8220;Shove off, O&#8217;Neil,&#8221; he exclaimed. &#8220;If we
stay here longer, I couldn&#8217;t resist the temptation
of pitching the whole lot of them overboard.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Excuse me for saying so, Mr. Perry,&#8221;
O&#8217;Neil apologized as the sailors rowed
back to their ship. &#8220;You&#8217;ve got to learn
caution when you&#8217;re playing against those
fellows. They are up in diplomacy. They
live on it, and to beat &#8217;em you&#8217;ve got to forget
you&#8217;ve got a temper. It ain&#8217;t at all necessary;
in fact, it&#8217;s a superfluity.&#8221; O&#8217;Neil
was fond of using big words, which he always
accented on every syllable, as if by so doing
their vague meaning would be more readily
grasped.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_110">[110]</span>When Phil returned Commander Tazewell
was on the point of embarking to visit the
Herzovinian war-ship, but after listening to
the startling intelligence brought by Phil he
at once decided that a visit at this time of
night would be barren of results. Kataafa
would probably obtain arms for his warriors
through the Kapuan firm. A higher power
than the Herzovinian commander had so
ordained. The fact was, however, worth
knowing. Plans must be made to meet this
new development. He might send trusty
men ashore to spy on those who were unloading
the &#8220;Talofa.&#8221;</p>

<p>Just then a native canoe ranged alongside,
while the paddler held up a letter. The
quartermaster went down to receive it; it
was for Commander Tazewell.</p>

<p>The captain opened it eagerly. The handwriting
was unfamiliar.</p>

<p>&#8220;My dear Commander Tazewell,&#8221; he read
in perfectly written English. He had already
glanced at the bottom for the name and had
seen &#8220;Your obedient servant, Felix Rosen.&#8221;
He continued to read: &#8220;I crave a thousand
pardons, but an opportunity has arisen for<span class="pagenum" id="Page_111">[111]</span>
me to take a cruise about the Kapuan Islands
in a schooner. She is now unloading. The
captain of our war-ship was kind enough to
come to my aid and direct the work. I believe
there is some government freight among
the cargo. I hope to get away in the morning,
so our trip to &#8216;Papasea&#8217; must only be
postponed. I have also excused myself to the
ladies.&#8221;</p>

<p>Commander Tazewell as he finished uttered
an exclamation of bewilderment. He handed
the letter to Lieutenant Morrison and then to
Phil.</p>

<p>Phil read the letter, while his indignation
increased at every line of the carefully worded
explanation. He was on the point of condemning
the entire crowd of schemers when
his glance fell upon the eager face of the captain&#8217;s
orderly, Schultz.</p>

<p>&#8220;Well!&#8221; Commander Tazewell exclaimed.
&#8220;They&#8217;ve had the last word. There&#8217;s no getting
behind that letter.&#8221;</p>

<p>He turned to Lieutenant Morrison, standing
expectantly waiting to hear what would
be the next move. &#8220;You may secure the
boats for the night,&#8221; he said.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER VII<br />


<small>THE KAPUAN FIRM</small></h2>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">Carl Klinger</span> had been sitting in his office
at the Kapuan firm&#8217;s store when a loud knocking
aroused him from his reveries. He rose
quickly to open the door.</p>

<p>&#8220;What do you want?&#8221; he inquired roughly
in Kapuan as he threw open the door. A
native, much out of breath from running,
confronted him. Klinger saw it was one of
the pilot&#8217;s boat-crew from the pilot station on
Matautu Point at the entrance to the harbor.</p>

<p>&#8220;The &#8216;Talofa&#8217; coming in through the entrance,&#8221;
the man replied. &#8220;Captain Svenson
send me to tell you quick.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;How do you know it&#8217;s the &#8216;Talofa&#8217;?&#8221;
Klinger asked incredulously. He could not
believe that Captain Scott would be so foolhardy
as to enter Ukula harbor with his
cargo. Twenty Solomon Island natives to
work on the plantations, actually kidnapped
from their homes, beside several thousand<span class="pagenum" id="Page_113">[113]</span>
Snyder rifles with millions of rounds of ammunition
constituted the greatest part of the
&#8220;Talofa&#8217;s&#8221; cargo. Had &#8220;Bully&#8221; Scott gone
mad?</p>

<p>&#8220;No other but Captain Scott could find the
entrance to the harbor on a night like this,&#8221;
the man replied positively. Klinger noted
the utter blackness of the night. He was
enough of a sailorman himself to understand
the dangers attending the navigation of a
vessel so large as the &#8220;Talofa.&#8221; Even the
pilots preferred to wait until daylight before
bringing a vessel through the treacherous
coral reefs.</p>

<p>&#8220;Wait,&#8221; he ordered. Then returning to his
desk he wrote several pages of a letter, sealed
and addressed it, then gave it to the native
messenger.</p>

<p>&#8220;Take this to the Tivoli Hotel,&#8221; he instructed.
&#8220;Find Count Rosen and give it
into no other hands.&#8221;</p>

<p>From the porch of the store he gazed upon
the harbor, but the darkness shrouded the
vessel for which his anxious eyes were searching.
His mind was sorely troubled. &#8220;Bully&#8221;
Scott was not a character to pin one&#8217;s faith to.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_114">[114]</span>
That hardened pirate went where either his
fancy led him or where the greatest amount
of coin awaited him. The guns had already
been paid for with Klinger&#8217;s money; only
the freight charges were due. The Solomon
Islanders were Scott&#8217;s own venture. The one
balanced the other. If he should betray the
Kapuan firm by permitting the war-ships to
confiscate them as contraband, then the presence
of the blacks would be known and must
convict the pirate in any court of the South
Seas. Nationality could not protect slave
trading, although it might the importation
of arms. The &#8220;Talofa&#8221; was sailing illegally
under Herzovinian protection. Count Rosen,
while in Fiji, had arranged for that with
Scott. A word from Klinger would cause
Scott to be arrested straightway and taken
before the chief justice. The penalty for slave
trading was at least ten years in a penal
colony.</p>

<p>&#8220;He may have discharged both the slaves
and the guns,&#8221; he exclaimed. Then he apparently
realized that this was impossible, for
he added aloud, &#8220;Couldn&#8217;t have done that,
or I should have heard of it by now.&#8221; As he<span class="pagenum" id="Page_115">[115]</span>
still gazed seaward he saw the lights of a war-ship
disappear one at a time, and knew that
the schooner was then passing between the
man-of-war and himself.</p>

<p>He called loudly to arouse some of the
native help who lived in houses back of the
store.</p>

<p>A native finally appeared.</p>

<p>&#8220;Get the boat boys,&#8221; Klinger ordered hurriedly.
&#8220;I shall require them at once.&#8221;</p>

<p>The schooner anchored only a few hundred
yards from him before the sleepy natives had
launched his boat. Klinger paced the sand
impatiently. He was consumed with anxiety
for the safety of his guns. Thirty thousand
dollars was to be the profit upon them. And
besides, the decision of the chief justice might
be given at any moment. Kataafa must have
these guns before the decision was rendered,
for that was required to carry out the &#8220;coup
de main&#8221; which must throw the Kapuan
Islands into the lap of his country.</p>

<p>Angry and bitter at the man who had
played fast and loose with his plans, Klinger
climbed the &#8220;Talofa&#8217;s&#8221; side and met the
culprit face to face.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_116">[116]</span>Klinger&#8217;s first question was more forceful
than elegant. Captain &#8220;Bully&#8221; Scott only
smiled in his urbane style and answered the
question in Kapuan.</p>

<p>&#8220;Hold your tongue. There&#8217;s an American
naval officer standing aft by the compass.&#8221;</p>

<p>Klinger saw by the dim lantern&#8217;s light the
sheen of a white duck uniform.</p>

<p>&#8220;What&#8217;s he doing here?&#8221; he asked suspiciously.</p>

<p>&#8220;Only a matter of natural curiosity,&#8221; Scott
replied.</p>

<p>&#8220;Tell me why you didn&#8217;t follow my instructions,&#8221;
Klinger asked. &#8220;Have you the
guns on board?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I have everything that I started out to
bring here,&#8221; Scott returned, &#8220;and what&#8217;s more
I&#8217;m going to land everything as snugly as
a down East whaler in winter quarters.&#8221;</p>

<p>Klinger felt much relieved. The calm
confidence of the man impressed him.</p>

<p>&#8220;How?&#8221; was all he could ask.</p>

<p>&#8220;Send off your cargo lighters as soon as
you can,&#8221; Scott explained. &#8220;Get the count
to ask for a few sailors from your war-ship to
stay here and prevent the English or Americans<span class="pagenum" id="Page_117">[117]</span>
from watching us. The count is then
to charter the &#8216;Talofa&#8217; for a pleasure trip
around the group of islands, starting as soon
as we are unloaded. We shall unload part of
the cargo to-night, at once.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t dare to take the guns ashore
here,&#8221; Klinger exclaimed. &#8220;We can&#8217;t keep
the knowledge away from these prying
natives.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Just leave that to me. They don&#8217;t go
ashore here; that&#8217;s my plan,&#8221; Captain Scott
replied soothingly. &#8220;You do as I tell you.
That&#8217;s all you need worry about. Does the
count know we are in?&#8221; he asked.</p>

<p>&#8220;I sent him a note as soon as I learned it,&#8221;
Klinger answered. &#8220;I don&#8217;t yet see what was
your object in coming here. Saluafata was
wide open.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;All you&#8217;ve got to figure on,&#8221; Scott said
quietly, &#8220;is that I&#8217;m here. Say something in
English now to throw that young cub naval
officer off the scent and go hurry off those
lighters. If you see the count tell him to
come off here or go and get those sailors
first.&#8221;</p>

<p>Klinger&#8217;s mind was relieved of much of the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_118">[118]</span>
strain of uncertainty, yet he felt far from sure
that Scott&#8217;s plan would succeed as easily as
the optimistic Scott imagined. He had not
entirely acquitted Scott of the charge of
perfidy.</p>

<p>The two men then spoke in English in
regard to the return cargo of the &#8220;Talofa,&#8221;
and parted apparently to meet again in the
morning.</p>

<p>As Klinger rowed ashore he met Count
Rosen going out to the schooner. The two
boats stopped alongside each other. Klinger
hurriedly outlined Scott&#8217;s plan as far as he
had learned it.</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll drop aboard just to satisfy myself that
he isn&#8217;t betraying us,&#8221; the count said to himself
as the two boats went their several ways.</p>

<p>As the count left the &#8220;Talofa&#8221; and rowed
toward the Herzovinian war-ship, he was
nearly convinced that Scott was playing fair,
but upon his return after picking up the white
man swimming toward the American war-ship,
distrust of the pirate again appeared
strongly in his mind.</p>

<p>Just before dawn Klinger saw the last one
of the many boxes brought ashore from the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_119">[119]</span>
schooner carried and piled upon the porch of
the store. The twenty new slaves brought by
Scott, for whom he had paid a handsome sum
of money to the schooner&#8217;s captain, had been
set to work unloading, and they were now on
their way under native guard to the Vaileli
plantation.</p>

<p>The boxes landed were of all sizes, and most
of them were left unopened upon the porch
of the store. Klinger stationed two of his
boat boys as guard, and then turned in upon
the small bed in his office.</p>

<p>&#8220;Mighty queer proceedings,&#8221; he exclaimed
as he closed his tired eyes. &#8220;But I guess the
count can handle the situation.&#8221;</p>

<p>When Count Rosen awakened the next
morning, his first act was to open the blinds
and glance out upon the harbor. Everything
was peaceful and serene; the &#8220;Talofa&#8221; lay
snugly at anchor. The firm&#8217;s lighters were
alongside the dock in front of the store. It
was low tide and the fringing reef was peopled
with natives gathering the many edibles,
turtle, crayfish and a variety of shell-fish, that
form a great proportion of the Kapuan diet.
The count entered the adjoining room; the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_120">[120]</span>
memory of the man picked up from the water
the night before had suddenly recurred to
him. The room was empty. He called
loudly for his native boy.</p>

<p>&#8220;Where is the stranger?&#8221; he asked.</p>

<p>&#8220;Gone out for a bath,&#8221; the boy answered
innocently, showing his white teeth in a
childlike smile.</p>

<p>&#8220;Bring him back at once,&#8221; the count commanded.
&#8220;Tell him I wish to see him.&#8221;</p>

<p>The boy hastened on his errand, jingling
several pieces of silver he had acquired from
the very stranger whom he was seeking.</p>

<p>The count dressed hastily and himself took
up the search for the missing man.</p>

<p>On the beach in front of the hotel he encountered
his boy quietly sitting in the sand,
his gaze upon the panorama of the bay.</p>

<p>&#8220;Where is he?&#8221; the count exclaimed, much
annoyed at the boy&#8217;s indifference.</p>

<p>&#8220;Afraid he&#8217;s not here,&#8221; the boy acknowledged.</p>

<p>If a look could kill the native would have
died on the spot.</p>

<p>It was evident that the stranger had sought
other protection.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_121">[121]</span>Much annoyed at losing this man, whom
he believed might have given him information
of value to hold over the head of Captain
Scott, he turned his steps toward his consulate.</p>

<p>Mr. Carlson was drinking tea on his porch
when the count arrived.</p>

<p>&#8220;I came to tell you,&#8221; the count said condescendingly,
&#8220;that I am taking a trip on that
schooner anchored in the bay. Klinger discharged
the cargo last night. It was all for
the Kapuan firm.&#8221;</p>

<p>The consul should have been consulted first
before discharging cargo, but he knew that to
hold his place as consul he must always meet
the demands of Klinger.</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;d like to have you give me the clearance
papers,&#8221; the count continued. &#8220;She will go
to the plantations for copra and then return
here. She&#8217;s now in ballast.&#8221;</p>

<p>Carlson called his native clerk and told him
to prepare the papers. The count was named
as supercargo for the trip.</p>

<p>After receiving the clearance papers the
count did not linger at the consulate.</p>

<p>&#8220;Remember, Mr. Carlson,&#8221; he said as he
rose to go, &#8220;if the chief justice decides not<span class="pagenum" id="Page_122">[122]</span>
to acknowledge Kataafa as king, you have
agreed to refuse to stand with the other consuls
to uphold that decision. The eagle,&#8221; he
added, &#8220;is a coveted decoration.&#8221;</p>

<p>The consul blushed with pleasure and smilingly
nodded his fat head vigorously.</p>

<p>Having eaten his breakfast and packed up
sufficient clothes to take with him in the
&#8220;Talofa,&#8221; the count strolled to the store.
Klinger having been up all night was yet
asleep in his office. The count seated himself
on the porch and sent word by one of the natives
standing guard over the freight from the
schooner.</p>

<p>Klinger appeared shortly.</p>

<p>&#8220;You did a good night&#8217;s work, I see,&#8221; said
the count.</p>

<p>Klinger nodded sleepily.</p>

<p>&#8220;Has Captain Scott a white man in his
crew?&#8221; the count asked.</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, of course. Stump,&#8221; the manager replied,
opening wide his eyes. &#8220;I remember now
I didn&#8217;t see him on the schooner last night.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;What does this Stump look like?&#8221; the
count asked. Klinger described him accurately.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_123">[123]</span>&#8220;That&#8217;s the very man,&#8221; the count exclaimed
in alarm. &#8220;He deserted the schooner and
tried to swim to the American war-ship. I
picked him out of the water nearly drowned,
and he slept at the Tivoli Hotel last night.
He&#8217;s now loose in Ukula, and may spoil everything
unless we can stop his tongue.&#8221;</p>

<p>Klinger, however, did not seem greatly
alarmed.</p>

<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s odd that Scott didn&#8217;t speak of it, but
I&#8217;m sure he can do no harm,&#8221; he replied
quietly. &#8220;Stump is a peaceful, simple soul.
Hasn&#8217;t sense enough to know how to harm anybody
except himself. We are sure to get the
arms to Kataafa, and the &#8216;black&#8217; boys are
now at Vaileli plantation.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;What are you going to do with these more
or less empty boxes?&#8221; the count suddenly
asked, tapping upon them with his cane, apparently
satisfied over the matter of Stump.</p>

<p>&#8220;Leave them right here until I again hear
from you,&#8221; Klinger replied. &#8220;They&#8217;ll arouse
every one&#8217;s curiosity and divert attention from
the &#8216;Talofa.&#8217;&#8221;</p>

<p>The count nodded. &#8220;But not without a
guard,&#8221; he said pointedly. &#8220;You must see<span class="pagenum" id="Page_124">[124]</span>
Carlson and have him order the war-ship&#8217;s
captain to send a file of sailors to spend the
night at the store. That will help us a great
deal, and,&#8221; he added, &#8220;don&#8217;t be too secret
about it.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I understand,&#8221; Klinger answered knowingly.</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll be off in the &#8216;Talofa&#8217; this forenoon,&#8221;
the count said, glancing out on the bay.
&#8220;There doesn&#8217;t seem to be much breeze, yet it
will be enough, I dare say, for the &#8216;Talofa&#8217;
to clear the entrance reefs.&#8221;</p>

<p>The count was on the point of taking his
departure. &#8220;Whoever comes ashore with the
sailor guard should thoroughly understand
what is expected of his men,&#8221; he continued.</p>

<p>Klinger reassured him, and as he watched
the commanding figure of the count disappear
down the road, the manager smiled in perfect
enjoyment. &#8220;They didn&#8217;t make any mistake
when they sent him to Kapua,&#8221; he exclaimed
admiringly.</p>

<p>Several hours later Klinger watched the
&#8220;Talofa&#8221; beat cleverly against a light head
wind out of the harbor. He watched the swift
schooner, under a full spread of canvas, sail to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_125">[125]</span>
the eastward until the point of Matautu, with
its high cliffs, shut her off from view.</p>

<p>&#8220;So Stump&#8217;s deserted that old pirate Scott
at last,&#8221; he said to himself amusedly. &#8220;When
thieves fall out,&#8221; he quoted. &#8220;I wonder where
the simpleton is at this minute.&mdash;I rather like
him,&#8221; he added thoughtfully, &#8220;and if I could
find him I&#8217;d be inclined to shield him from
that hypocrite of a sea-pirate.&#8221;</p>

<p>A native came briskly along the road advancing
toward Klinger, a letter held out to
him. Klinger took it, opened and read.</p>

<div class="blockquot2">

<p>&#8220;If Stump turns up after I am gone lock
him up. I will explain when I return.</p>

<p class="right">&#8220;<span class="smcap">Scott.</span>&#8221;</p>
</div>

<p>Klinger tore the note into small pieces,
strewing them on the ground as he walked
rapidly toward the center of the town.</p>

<p>At the municipal building he stopped.
Several native policemen lounged about on
the ground or squatted upon rude wooden
benches.</p>

<p>&#8220;Hey, Johnny Upolu!&#8221; he called, and a
tall, finely muscled native, attired in a blue<span class="pagenum" id="Page_126">[126]</span>
cotton lava-lava<a id="FNanchor_14" href="#Footnote_14" class="fnanchor">[14]</a> and helmet, hurriedly drew
on his blue policeman&#8217;s coat over his nakedness.</p>

<p>&#8220;You know Stump, mate of the &#8216;Talofa&#8217;?&#8221;
he said. The chief of the municipal police
smiled knowingly. &#8220;He&#8217;s been up to mischief
and the consul wants him taken up.&#8221;</p>

<p>Johnny smiled proudly. He was a strong
partisan of Kataafa, and was only too eager
to show his friendliness to the papalangi,
who were backing his favorite chief.</p>

<p>&#8220;All right, Missi Klinger,&#8221; he replied in a
strictly businesslike voice. &#8220;I&#8217;ll get him.&#8221;</p>

<p>Klinger smiled his satisfaction and passed
on his way.</p>

<p>At the consulate his reception was none too
cordial. Carlson disliked the ascendency
which this manager of a commercial firm had
over one occupying the office of representative
of his government, especially as Klinger
made no attempt to soften this evident fact
by any &#8220;finesse&#8221; whatsoever. Klinger openly
accused the consul of being soft-hearted, and
too friendly with the English and Americans.</p>

<p>&#8220;I must ride to Faleula plantation to-night,&#8221;<span class="pagenum" id="Page_127">[127]</span>
Klinger said brusquely after he had seated
himself. &#8220;I haven&#8217;t had time to unpack and
stow away some valuable cargo just received
from the &#8216;Talofa,&#8217; and I want a guard of
sailors from the war-ship to protect the store
during my absence.&#8221;</p>

<p>Carlson glanced at Klinger in open-eyed
surprise.</p>

<p>&#8220;What will come next?&#8221; he exclaimed.
&#8220;Sailors to guard your store from robbers!
Who are the robbers?&#8221;</p>

<p>Klinger shrugged his shoulders contemptuously.</p>

<p>&#8220;Maybe your friends the English and
Americans,&#8221; he said calmly. &#8220;I have asked
you for a guard. I know the business of the
firm better than you do. That&#8217;s what I&#8217;m
paid for.&#8221;</p>

<p>The consul bit his lips in suppressed rage.</p>

<p>&#8220;Is this another one of your tricks,&#8221; the
consul exclaimed, &#8220;to further mortify me?&#8221;
He had in mind only too vividly another
occasion where Klinger had demanded sailors
to guard his property and then had hoisted
the flag at the municipal flagstaff, telling all
the natives that his country had annexed the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_128">[128]</span>
islands. The flag remained flying only until
the next mail arrived, when the consul was
severely reprimanded by his government and
was forced to haul down the flag and rehoist
the Kapuan ensign in its place.</p>

<p>&#8220;I want about a dozen sailors,&#8221; Klinger insisted.
&#8220;If you need a little leg stiffening,&#8221;
he added cruelly, &#8220;I don&#8217;t mind telling you
that Count Rosen approves, even suggested
the action.&#8221; Klinger had sized up his hearer.</p>

<p>&#8220;That puts another aspect on the question,&#8221;
Carlson exclaimed, much mollified by the
mention of the count&#8217;s concurrence. &#8220;When
do you require these sailors?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;By four o&#8217;clock this afternoon,&#8221; Klinger
replied, &#8220;and I forgot to say I told the chief
of police in your name to arrest and hold one
Stump, a deserter from the &#8216;Talofa.&#8217;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Stump! Why, he&#8217;s English or American!&#8221;
Carlson exclaimed alarmedly. &#8220;I&#8217;m having
enough trouble without borrowing more.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Another suggestion of the count,&#8221; Klinger
said quietly. &#8220;Please send a written warrant
to Johnny Upolu at once.&#8221;</p>

<div class="figcenter"><img src="images/i_128.jpg" alt="" /></div>
<p class="caption">&#8220;I WANT ABOUT A DOZEN SAILORS&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, well, then, that&#8217;s all right,&#8221; the consul
replied, again changing his tone of voice.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_129">[129]</span>
&#8220;The count, Klinger, is a very brilliant diplomat
and I&#8217;m sure would not suggest anything
which would get me into trouble.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I dare say,&#8221; Klinger said with a smirk.
&#8220;The difference between you and the count
in diplomacy is that he knows what he
wants.&#8221;</p>

<p>Carlson turned very red, but upon second
thoughts appeared not to notice the implied
insult.</p>

<p>With a curt good-morning Klinger took his
departure.</p>

<p>&#8220;Why do they send such mountains of
ignorance and conceit to manage our political
affairs?&#8221; he complained. He little reckoned
that a wise government had sent Carlson to
act as a check upon Klinger. The radical
Klinger and the conservative Carlson gave
the exact mixture required.</p>

<p>At exactly four o&#8217;clock the sailors arrived.
Klinger took aside the petty officer in charge
and in detail laid down for him the course he
was to follow during his absence.</p>

<p>Then he mounted his little pony and turned
its head toward Kulinuu, the seat of government
of the uncrowned king, Kataafa.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_130">[130]</span>Arriving at the king&#8217;s house, he entered
and was ceremoniously received.</p>

<p>Kava was made and all the chiefs were
gathered to drink.</p>

<p>Klinger talked for nearly an hour, explaining
and directing. Then he rose and bade
a ceremonious farewell. Accompanied by
several mounted natives he departed, and in
the gathering darkness took the trail leading
back of Ukula and toward the eastward, while
Faleula, where he told Carson he was going,
lay in exactly the opposite direction.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER VIII<br />


<small>AVAO, TAPAU OF UKULA</small></h2>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">The</span> morning following the arrival of the
schooner, Phil and Sydney were on deck
early. The &#8220;Talofa&#8221; was still at anchor.
The canoe barges were lying alongside the
dock at the store of the Kapuan firm. Herzovinian
colors were flying on the schooner.
Phil had given his friend a full account of the
perplexing happenings of the night before.</p>

<p>&#8220;If the schooner brought guns where are
they now?&#8221; Phil asked.</p>

<p>Sydney shook his head. &#8220;Ask me something
easier,&#8221; he replied. &#8220;I&#8217;m not good at
conundrums.&#8221;</p>

<p>After morning quarters and drill the midshipmen
dressed for a visit ashore. This was
only the second day of their arrival and each
was full of eager interest to explore. Their
shipmates poked much good-natured fun at
them for their strenuosity.</p>

<p>&#8220;Hitting the beach before lunch?&#8221; the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_132">[132]</span>
doctor inquired with mock gravity. &#8220;I&#8217;m
afraid I&#8217;ll have to examine your sanity.&#8221;</p>

<p>After landing they walked along the main
road toward the Kapuan firm&#8217;s store. As
they passed, the portly figure of Klinger could
be seen within the doorway, while on the
porch a score or more of large boxes were displayed
to view. A glance at the barges lying
at the wooden dock showed them to be empty.
The cargo had been discharged during the
night.</p>

<p>&#8220;The &#8216;Talofa&#8217;s&#8217; getting up anchor,&#8221; Sydney
suddenly exclaimed.</p>

<p>The schooner&#8217;s mainsail had been set and
the crew were plainly seen heaving around
the capstan, weighing the anchor.</p>

<p>&#8220;The count is off on his cruise about the
islands,&#8221; Phil said. &#8220;I wonder,&#8221; he added
thoughtfully, &#8220;if those boxes really do contain
arms?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Very likely,&#8221; his companion answered,
&#8220;but come on. You can&#8217;t look through their
wooden sides.&#8221;</p>

<p>At the house of Chief Tuamana, Avao met
them with a demure smile of welcome on her
comely face.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_133">[133]</span>&#8220;Missi Alice is here,&#8221; she cried out to them
joyously as she took each by the hand and led
them into the cool shelter under her father&#8217;s
roof tree.</p>

<p>The midshipmen glanced about for Alice.
The big room was deserted, but from behind
the tapa curtain came much merry laughter,
and finally Alice appeared dragging with her
two very shy young native girls.</p>

<p>&#8220;We&#8217;re going to make Kava Fa&#8217;a Kapua,&#8221;<a id="FNanchor_15" href="#Footnote_15" class="fnanchor">[15]</a>
she said as she seated herself native fashion,
&#8220;and then we&#8217;re going out to &#8216;Jumping Rock&#8217;
for a swim. If you care to go we shall be delighted
to have you join us,&#8221; she told the
midshipmen.</p>

<p>Avao brought out a small piece of kava
root, holding it out for Alice to inspect.</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m the alii,&#8221;<a id="FNanchor_16" href="#Footnote_16" class="fnanchor">[16]</a> Alice said. &#8220;I&#8217;m supposed
to judge if the root is of good quality before
the Tapau chews it.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Chews it!&#8221; Phil exclaimed. &#8220;I thought
it was to be a drink.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;So it is,&#8221; Alice replied, thoroughly enjoying<span class="pagenum" id="Page_134">[134]</span>
the depth of Phil&#8217;s ignorance of the
Kapuan custom. &#8220;Avao is the &#8216;Tapau&#8217;; she
will chew the kava root; look!&#8221; she exclaimed
admiringly.</p>

<p>The midshipmen turned their eyes toward
Avao. Her cheeks were already bulging as
she sat stoically ruminating the root while
one of the other girls fed her from time to
time an additional sliver.</p>

<p>For fully fifteen minutes Avao was busily
engaged in reducing the root to a pulpy mass
which finally she held in her hand and then
put into the kava bowl beside her.</p>

<p>Next came the washing. Pure water was
poured carefully over the mass and Avao
daintily cleansed her hands and then gracefully
squatted before the bowl.</p>

<p>While one girl poured water slowly into the
bowl, Avao kneaded the material vigorously.
The liquid soon began to assume a greenish
tinge, and the midshipmen involuntarily shuddered
at the idea of drinking the concoction.</p>

<p>&#8220;Do you know, kava never agrees with
me,&#8221; Phil said in an aside, in order not to
hurt the feelings of their native friends, &#8220;especially
in the morning.&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_135">[135]</span>&#8220;I never could see anything in it either,&#8221;
Sydney answered. &#8220;I&#8217;d much prefer a lemonade
or a drink of cocoanut milk.&#8221;</p>

<p>Alice overheard the remarks and smiled
wickedly. &#8220;This is probably the last real
cup of kava you&#8217;ll get,&#8221; she said. &#8220;The
chewing has gone out of fashion since the
fomais<a id="FNanchor_17" href="#Footnote_17" class="fnanchor">[17]</a> have taught the Kapuans about the
spread of germs. We got this up especially
for your benefit.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It was awfully good of you,&#8221; Phil acknowledged
miserably, &#8220;but really I don&#8217;t
believe I need any kava this morning.&#8221;</p>

<p>Avao was now working a strainer<a id="FNanchor_18" href="#Footnote_18" class="fnanchor">[18]</a> to and
fro in the liquid. The grace of her motions
was delightful to see and elicited much admiration
from the midshipmen. Finally,
with a last fleck of the strainer, she dropped
it into the bowl and clapped her shapely hands.</p>

<p>All present took up the clapping. It was
the sign that the kava was ready to be
served.</p>

<p>The midshipmen dreaded the ordeal. &#8220;I
feel like a kid about to be given a dose of bad
medicine,&#8221; Sydney whispered.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_136">[136]</span>One of the attendant girls then arose with
&#8220;hipu&#8221;<a id="FNanchor_19" href="#Footnote_19" class="fnanchor">[19]</a> in hand. She held the cocoanut shell
cup over the bowl, while Avao squeezed the
liquid into it from the strainer. The midshipmen
were amazed at the charm and grace
in every movement. Each time the strainer
was squeezed the cup bearer swung the cup
in a circle. She then faced about and, with
the cup held at the level of her dainty chin,
directed her dark eyes toward Phil.</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m it,&#8221; he groaned.</p>

<p>Alice, bubbling over with mischief, exclaimed:
&#8220;A cup of kava for Mr. Perry.&#8221;</p>

<p>The next second the cup of greenish liquid,
after a graceful underhand curve, as the girl
bent her knees, was held before the disconsolate
lad.</p>

<p>&#8220;Cheer up,&#8221; Sydney exclaimed. &#8220;Hold
your nose and shut your eyes and she&#8217;ll give
you something to make you wise.&#8221;</p>

<p>Phil took the cup gingerly. To his horror
it was nearly full to the brim.</p>

<p>&#8220;Must I drink it all?&#8221; he asked Alice
nervously.</p>

<p>&#8220;If you don&#8217;t, I am afraid Avao will look<span class="pagenum" id="Page_137">[137]</span>
for another &#8216;felinge,&#8217;&#8221; she replied teasingly.</p>

<p>&#8220;Count for me, Syd,&#8221; Phil said, &#8220;and when
you see the folks at home, say I died game.&#8221;</p>

<p>He calmly swallowed the contents without
drawing breath, and handed the cup back to
the girl.</p>

<p>&#8220;Thanks awfully, no more just now,&#8221; he
said laughing, happy the ordeal was over.</p>

<p>&#8220;What&#8217;s it like?&#8221; Sydney asked.</p>

<p>&#8220;More like drinking slate pencils than anything
else I can imagine.&#8221;</p>

<p>Sydney drank his, shuddering slightly at
the bitter taste. All the others, including
Alice, drank as if they thoroughly enjoyed it.</p>

<p>&#8220;You get accustomed to it,&#8221; Alice explained.
&#8220;The Kapuans drink it as we do
coffee or tea.&#8221;</p>

<p>After kava was over the lads found that
native ponies had been provided by Avao,
and within a half hour the cavalcade started.
A dozen or more of Kapuan men brought up
the rear on foot, carrying many kinds of fruit
and edibles wrapped in banana leaves.</p>

<p>Alice and Avao led the procession, while
the midshipmen came next. They trotted<span class="pagenum" id="Page_138">[138]</span>
along a sylvan path for about a mile, then in
single file through the wet &#8220;bush.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It was lucky for us we happened along,&#8221;
Phil said to Alice as they halted to admire a
great banyan tree close to the path.</p>

<p>&#8220;It was only by accident I am here, too,&#8221;
she answered. &#8220;Tuamana, Avao&#8217;s father, and
all the chiefs loyal to Panu, are in council at
the &#8216;Jumping Rock.&#8217; The girls are taking
their feast to them.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh!&#8221; Phil exclaimed. &#8220;Maybe they will
not be glad to see us.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;The Kapuan is always delighted to have
papalangi at his feasts,&#8221; Alice assured him;
&#8220;especially as they know the Americans are
very friendly to Panu&#8217;s claim to the throne.
The Kataafa chiefs might not be so cordial if
we dropped in on them.&#8221;</p>

<p>The two midshipmen were amazed at the
sight when the place chosen for the council
had been reached. A score or more of warriors
were found squatting in the grass near
the huge rock over which the Vaisaigo stream
plunged. A large pool of dark water below
the falls was thus kept filled, and where the
solid stream curved and fell the blackness<span class="pagenum" id="Page_139">[139]</span>
was changed to white foam and iridescent
spray.</p>

<p>They found the council was over. The
business having been finished the chiefs were
ready to eat and then after a time bathe in
the deep pool beneath them.</p>

<p>Tuamana made the midshipmen and Alice
sit beside him, and all the best things to eat
were pressed upon the visitors.</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m glad there&#8217;s no more kava,&#8221; Phil said
in an aside to Alice.</p>

<p>After the feast, consisting of roast young
pig, yams, breadfruit, roast chicken and
many kinds of tropical fruit, Tuamana called
Avao to him. The father talked to his
daughter fully fifteen minutes. Phil noticed
that both were serious and solemn. Alice
had meanwhile risen and wandered away
with two of her Kapuan girl friends, to
gather the many variegated flowers and leaves
so plentiful in the virgin forests. The lads,
left to themselves, eyed in wonder the warrior
chiefs seated now in small groups; some were
motionless, a look of deep contemplation upon
their intelligent bronze faces, while others
talked, but with the same solemn expression.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_140">[140]</span>
Each wore the fighting head-dress of human
hair, standing above a band of gleaming pearl-shell
knobs clasped around the forehead. In
the center of this marvelous, barbaric creation
of a head-dress and to add picturesqueness and
color, a bunch of long red feathers plucked
from the boatswain bird waved in the breeze,
while in the middle of each forehead, reflecting
the sunlight as it filtered through the
dense foliage above them, was a small mirror.
About their necks were hung necklaces of the
scarlet pandanus fruit. About their waists
and hanging half-way to their knees were
tapa and mats of finely woven grass. Below
this their only covering, the indigo tattooing,
was visible above their knees. Every warrior
when he reaches manhood must submit to the
old women tattooers; they cover the would-be
warrior with their intricate designs from
the waist to the knee, and to refuse to be
tattooed is considered by a Kapuan a crime
against manhood.</p>

<p>Many of the warrior chiefs, as they arose
to cool themselves in the icy cold waters of
the Vaisaigo, stopped and shook hands with
the two officers.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_141">[141]</span>&#8220;They seem to think there is a tacit understanding
between them and ourselves,&#8221;
Phil said to Sydney as one chief after shaking
hands brought his &#8220;fui&#8221;<a id="FNanchor_20" href="#Footnote_20" class="fnanchor">[20]</a> to his shoulder as
if it were a gun and took aim at an imaginary
enemy. &#8220;I wonder if there is,&#8221; he added
thoughtfully. &#8220;That chap&#8217;s sign language
either means you are going to furnish him a
gun, or that he and we are going gunning together
after the same human game.&#8221;</p>

<p>Avao, after being dismissed by her father, at
once took Phil and Sydney by the hand, as is
the Kapuan custom, and led the lads to the
side of the pool.</p>

<p>In a few minutes the deep pool was a lively
scene; men and women were jumping one
after another from the top of the rock, full
thirty feet, into the deep pool below.</p>

<p>After one or two jumps the lads decided
that to watch the sport was more interesting
than engaging in it. The icy cold water was
deliciously refreshing but soon chilled them
to the marrow.</p>

<p>&#8220;I see the reason for the plentiful use of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_142">[142]</span>
cocoanut oil,&#8221; Sydney chattered as they
donned their clothes. &#8220;The natives are in
the water most of the time, either in the
ocean or in one of these mountain streams,
and the water flows off them like off a duck&#8217;s
back. We with our unoiled dry skins get
the chill from evaporation.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;d rather have the chill,&#8221; Phil replied,
shivering to keep Sydney company.</p>

<p>&#8220;What is the reason of this meeting, anyway?&#8221;
Sydney asked. &#8220;Has it a meaning?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I have an idea,&#8221; Phil said, &#8220;that Tuamana
was displeased with Avao for bringing us.
Did you notice that as soon as Alice Lee was
led away by her two girl friends, the chief
called Avao to him? I think he was laying
down the law to her.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I think you must be wrong, Phil,&#8221; Sydney
replied shaking his head. &#8220;Every one seemed
so glad to see us.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;The Kapuans are noted as the most
generous and friendly nation in the world,&#8221;
Phil returned. &#8220;It&#8217;s almost a religion with
them. To hurt a stranger&#8217;s feelings by rebuke
or inhospitality is something rarely known to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_143">[143]</span>
have happened. But come on,&#8221; he ended.
&#8220;I see our party beckoning us.&#8221;</p>

<p>They clambered up the side of the ragged
rock and were soon where their ponies were
tethered.</p>

<p>Alice called the midshipmen to her side.</p>

<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s unfortunate for you that we came,&#8221;
she said, but her eager, excited face showed no
sign of sorrow.</p>

<p>&#8220;I thought so,&#8221; Phil exclaimed. &#8220;What is
it, though?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;The council has prepared a &#8216;tonga-fiti&#8217;<a id="FNanchor_21" href="#Footnote_21" class="fnanchor">[21]</a>
on the Kapuan firm, and you two American
officers having been here at the council,
Klinger will not believe you are innocent.&#8221;
Alice could not keep back her joyful smile.
&#8220;Klinger will probably say you put the
Kapuans up to it.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;What are they going to do?&#8221; both lads
asked in one breath.</p>

<p>&#8220;They have heard of the landing of the
guns for Kataafa from the &#8216;Talofa,&#8217;&#8221; she replied
excitedly, &#8220;and to-night they are going to
break into the store if necessary, open the
boxes and seize the guns. They say that this<span class="pagenum" id="Page_144">[144]</span>
is the only way they can overcome the great
advantage in warriors that Kataafa has over
Panu, their choice for king. Then they are
to turn the guns over to Judge Lindsay.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Gee!&#8221; Phil exclaimed. &#8220;What a box for
us to be in. Who told you? Avao?&#8221; he
asked.</p>

<p>Alice nodded. &#8220;Tuamana gave her a severe
scolding and told her to say nothing, but of
course you know women, and Kapuan women
in particular, would die in keeping a secret, so
she confided in all of us while you were in
swimming.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;What are we going to do?&#8221; Sydney asked
after they had mounted their ponies and were
riding slowly down the steep bush trail.</p>

<p>&#8220;I wish Avao had kept her secret,&#8221; Phil
replied, annoyed. &#8220;Knowing this we must
take our information to Commander Tazewell
at once; but don&#8217;t say anything before Miss
Alice. She is too thoroughly Kapuan to understand
our reasons.&#8221;</p>

<p>Sydney readily agreed.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER IX<br />


<small>O&#8217;NEIL&#8217;S OPINION</small></h2>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">&#8220;Say,</span> Jack,&#8221; Bill Marley exclaimed, as he
and Boatswain&#8217;s Mate Jack O&#8217;Neil, both sailormen
from the U. S. S. &#8220;Sitka,&#8221; ambled slowly
along the beach road of Ukula, &#8220;where are
we going to get off in this row everybody seems
to think is going to start when Judge Lindsay
tells Kataafa to climb down from his tinsel
throne and take to the tall timbers?&#8221;</p>

<p>Jack O&#8217;Neil posed before his shipmates as
an oracle upon Kapuan affairs. He had survived
the wreck of an American war-ship in
the great hurricane nearly ten years before,
and had lived in Ukula many months until
relief ships could come from the United States.</p>

<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t just know, Bill,&#8221; he replied
thoughtfully. &#8220;These Herzovinians always
did mix things up so that it was only a guess
what was going to happen next. You see,&#8221; he
added confidentially, &#8220;the Kapuan firm has<span class="pagenum" id="Page_146">[146]</span>
annexed about all the land along the coast,
and in the valleys of this and other islands,
and owning all this land they don&#8217;t like to
&#8216;kowtow&#8217;<a id="FNanchor_22" href="#Footnote_22" class="fnanchor">[22]</a> to a brown king with a topknot of
false hair on his cranium, and a grass mat
slung careless like about his waist line. Kapua
for the Herzovinians is what they want, and
they&#8217;ve had that idea stuck in their heads for
a good many years.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Well,&#8221; replied Marley, &#8220;what do we care?
Haven&#8217;t we got enough land on our hands?
Look at all the bad lands out west there in the
states which we haven&#8217;t got no use for, and
then all the land in the Philippines that our
little brown brother is fighting us to keep for
himself. Ain&#8217;t we got enough trouble without
stirring it up way down here south of the
equator?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;What do you know about politics?&#8221; O&#8217;Neil
exclaimed severely. &#8220;Come on into Mary
Hamilton&#8217;s shack, and we&#8217;ll get her to
&#8216;buscar&#8217;<a id="FNanchor_23" href="#Footnote_23" class="fnanchor">[23]</a> some nice green cocoanuts, and I&#8217;ll
tell you a little Kapuan history that&#8217;ll put you
wise to this intricate situation. I can only tell<span class="pagenum" id="Page_147">[147]</span>
you, Bill,&#8221; O&#8217;Neil added playfully, &#8220;but I
can&#8217;t give you the brains to understand.&#8221;</p>

<p>Marley smiled good-naturedly. &#8220;I don&#8217;t
know as you&#8217;re so all fired smart,&#8221; he replied.
&#8220;When I&#8217;ve wasted as many years as you
have, I suppose I&#8217;ll know almost as much
as you do.&#8221; Marley was nearly ten years
O&#8217;Neil&#8217;s junior.</p>

<p>&#8220;Go to it!&#8221; O&#8217;Neil exclaimed admiringly.
&#8220;You ain&#8217;t entirely dead, are you? Don&#8217;t be
a music box all your life, Bill, that&#8217;s my
advice to you. Play yourself sometimes.
There&#8217;s nothing like a little friendly argument
to keep the brain well greased up.
Now you know, or you ought to know at
any rate, that a gun that ain&#8217;t worked every
day will get all gummed up. That&#8217;s the way
it is with our brains if they ain&#8217;t worked. I
was afraid,&#8221; he ended, &#8220;your head had drawn
a sweetbread instead of a brain.&#8221;</p>

<p>Mary Hamilton welcomed them to her
home. Both sailormen apparently were old
friends of this accomplished woman. In spite
of her name she was not a &#8220;papalangi.&#8221; Old
Captain Alexander Hamilton, whose record in
the islands was good but not entirely spotless,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_148">[148]</span>
had taken Mele to wife some fifteen years
before, and not many years after this happy
event, sailed his small trading schooner out
of Ukula harbor never to return. Some had
said that &#8220;Alex&#8221; was living happily in the
Fiji, but Mele, or Mary, as most every one
called her, believed that he and his vessel
had met disaster in a big storm at sea. Mary
had finally remarried, this time to a chief of
her own race. Captain Hamilton had owned
considerable property in Ukula, all of which
had come to Mary; so despite being a widow,
she had been sought by many powerful chiefs.
Mary was a linguist. She spoke both English
and Herzovinian fluently and was as popular
with one faction as with the other.</p>

<p>&#8220;How&#8217;s it for a couple of cocoanuts?&#8221;
O&#8217;Neil asked.</p>

<p>Mary nodded graciously and called loudly
in Kapuan for the fruit.</p>

<p>Several girls came shyly forward and
hospitably attended to the comforts of their
guests. Mary sat on her mat facing the
squatting sailors, and smilingly watched
them quench their tropical thirst with the
refreshing juice, drunk from the green cocoanut<span class="pagenum" id="Page_149">[149]</span>
itself, out of a small hole cut dexterously
in the soft shell by two strokes from a heavy
knife used for the purpose.</p>

<p>&#8220;Mary and I can tell you lots of history
of these islands that never has been written
in books,&#8221; O&#8217;Neil said proudly after he had
smacked his lips and thrown the empty
cocoanut shell among others in the corner of
the house. &#8220;Mary&#8217;s present husband was
fighting once with Kataafa against the Herzovinians.
How&#8217;s he going to fight this
time?&#8221; O&#8217;Neil asked suddenly.</p>

<p>Mary put a shapely finger to her lips.</p>

<p>&#8220;I figure that he&#8217;s got to go against his old
chief. Mary Hamilton&#8217;s husband never could
fight against the Americans.&#8221; O&#8217;Neil&#8217;s voice
was persuasively commanding.</p>

<p>Mary shook her head and patted her sailor
friend affectionately on the shoulder.</p>

<p>&#8220;Fa&#8217;a Kapua,&#8221; she replied. &#8220;Husband
maybe fight on one side, wife still stay friend
with other side.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s the Kapuan custom all right,&#8221;
O&#8217;Neil hastened to say, &#8220;but that ain&#8217;t the
kind of friends we&#8217;re looking for. We want
you and the old man too on our side; for,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_150">[150]</span>
Mary, we&#8217;re going to be on the right side.
We ain&#8217;t looking for land. We ain&#8217;t swiping
native property and refusing to give it back.
But hold on,&#8221; he added interrupting himself,
&#8220;I promised to give Bill here a lesson in
Kapuan history. You correct me, Mary,&#8221; he
said, &#8220;if I wander from the truth. In
spinning yarns these days if you just tell
things that happened and don&#8217;t invent
some, your audience&#8217;ll go to sleep before your
eyes.</p>

<p>&#8220;The king that just passed over to the
&#8216;happy fishing grounds,&#8217;&#8221; O&#8217;Neil began, &#8220;was
a long time ago, when first made king, no
friend of the Herzovinians, so they kidnapped
him and sent him into exile. A native chief
named Samasese was put in the &#8216;chair&#8217; by
our friends in the Kapuan firm, and this
same chief Kataafa then declared war on
Samasese. Kataafa licked the king&#8217;s army
through the town from one end to the other.
I saw the fight;&mdash;went along with &#8217;em, and
had to make a hundred yards in ten seconds
flat, getting to cover when the Herzovinian
war-ship opened fire on Kataafa&#8217;s warriors.
If she hadn&#8217;t come to Samasese&#8217;s help, Kataafa<span class="pagenum" id="Page_151">[151]</span>
would have run him clean over the point of
Kulinuu into the sea.</p>

<p>&#8220;Those certainly were warm times. Eh,
Mary?&#8221; O&#8217;Neil exclaimed enthusiastically.
&#8220;We had a skipper named O&#8217;Malley in command
of the old corvette &#8216;Wyoming.&#8217; Stevenson,
the great writer, was living then in that
big bungalow you can see on the hill back of
the town, and he got lots of good material for
his books out of the way O&#8217;Malley handled
the situation.</p>

<p>&#8220;O&#8217;Malley didn&#8217;t care who was king, only
he didn&#8217;t cotton to the high-handed way the
Herzovinians were running things and asking
nobody&#8217;s consent,&#8221; the sailor continued, his
Irish blue eyes sparkling with joy at the
remembrance. &#8220;Samasese was &#8216;treed&#8217; at
Kulinuu and Kataafa with several thousand
warriors was surrounding him. There was
an American beachcomber named Blacklock
who owned a house just outside of the Samasese
lines. One night a party of natives from
Kulinuu broke into his house to get some
grub to eat. They scared Blacklock nearly
into a fit. The same night he got on board
the &#8216;Wyoming&#8217; and told a horrible story of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_152">[152]</span>
brutality to O&#8217;Malley. The American commander
landed his sailors the next day and
encamped at the outraged house. The &#8216;Wyoming&#8217;
anchored in a position to shell the
Samasese forts at Kulinuu. O&#8217;Malley, then,
all day long wagged his Irish tongue as if it
was mounted on a swivel and run by a six
cylinder gasoline motor. All Ukula said
that at sunrise the next day, unless Samasese
dug out of Kulinuu O&#8217;Malley sure was going
to use the king&#8217;s camp for his annual target
practice.</p>

<p>&#8220;The next morning there wasn&#8217;t anything
alive at Kulinuu except dogs and pigs.
Samasese skinned out during the night, and
was landed by a Herzovinian war-ship&#8217;s boats
down the coast there about six miles.&#8221;</p>

<p>O&#8217;Neil took a deep breath and brushed an
insistent fly off his forehead. &#8220;Kataafa
wasn&#8217;t a bit frightened at Herzovinia,&#8221; he
continued admiringly; &#8220;he&#8217;s a great fighter,
Bill, I can tell you, and if we get into a row
with him there&#8217;s going to be something doing.
Kataafa then got a good start and went up
against Samasese good and hard. A sad
thing for old &#8216;Kat.&#8217; Some of his warriors<span class="pagenum" id="Page_153">[153]</span>
tore down a couple of painted Herzovinian
flags and used them for &#8216;lava-lavas.&#8217; The
outraged commodore swore vengeance and declared
war on the spot. Kataafa had to run
and get his men into a fort before the Herzovinian
sailors attacked him. He was just
about snugly fixed when a war-ship came
trailing along close to the reef to bombard
this fort and the native town all around it.
Just behind this ship came O&#8217;Malley&#8217;s ship, the
&#8216;Wyoming,&#8217; and the game old Irishman was
on the bridge. He wore riding leggins, a
sign that he was going to surprise somebody,
and an angelic smile was spread all over his
face. When the Herzovinian ship stopped
and began to lower her gun ports and run
out her guns for business, we followed suit.
I thought we&#8217;d be on the reef, sure. O&#8217;Malley
ran the &#8216;Wyoming&#8217; inside the other war-ship
and hung there between her and Kataafa&#8217;s
fort.</p>

<p>&#8220;The other ship made all kinds of foxy
moves, but O&#8217;Malley covered the plate all the
time.</p>

<p>&#8220;It was nearly sunset when we heard a
voice pipe up from the other ship. Everybody<span class="pagenum" id="Page_154">[154]</span>
knew it was the commodore who was
talking.</p>

<p>&#8220;&#8216;I&#8217;m going to open fire on my enemy in
that town yonder in about five minutes.
Kindly chase yourself.&#8217;&#8221; O&#8217;Neil glanced at
Mary for a few seconds. &#8220;Those weren&#8217;t the
exact words, maybe, but that was what was
meant, anyway.</p>

<p>&#8220;Captain O&#8217;Malley&#8217;s smile got bigger. He
took off his white helmet and waved it encouragingly.</p>

<p>&#8220;&#8216;Go ahead,&#8217; he returned. &#8216;I&#8217;m in the
front row and have paid for my ticket.
Money won&#8217;t be refunded at the box office
this time.&#8217;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;What happened?&#8221; Bill Marley exclaimed
eagerly. &#8220;Did you have a scrap?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Did we have war with Herzovinia ten
years ago?&#8221; O&#8217;Neil asked contemptuously.
&#8220;No! of course we didn&#8217;t, or even you&#8217;d &#8217;a&#8217;
heard of it.</p>

<p>&#8220;The other ship gave up the game at sunset
and we followed her back to Ukula,&#8221;
O&#8217;Neil continued after Marley&#8217;s interruption
had been settled.</p>

<p>&#8220;A few days later the commodore tried a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_155">[155]</span>
new stunt: to disarm the natives this time.
The Herzovinians landed at night on the big
plantation of Vaileli. The Kataafa warriors
got news that they were coming from some
women in Ukula. I&#8217;ll bet,&#8221; he said insinuatingly,
&#8220;that Mary Hamilton can tell you
who the women were.&#8221;</p>

<p>Mary smiled. &#8220;I was blamed,&#8221; she replied.
&#8220;My second husband was with Kataafa and I
arrived a few hours before the sailors landed.&#8221;</p>

<p>O&#8217;Neil nodded. &#8220;Yes,&#8221; he said, &#8220;and there
was an American who also was accused by
the other side of carrying the news. Anyway,
the Kataafa warriors attacked the Herzovinian
sailors. Surprised them, killed about twenty
and wounded twice as many. It was an awful
shock to us all, and showed us we had been
playing too close to a playful volcano. Such a
thing had never occurred before. We thought
the natives would not dare to raise their
hands against the whites.</p>

<p>&#8220;I was on board another ship then; the
&#8216;Wyoming&#8217; had gone home to be paid off,&#8221;
O&#8217;Neil continued after an impressive silence.
&#8220;The worst of it all was that the heads were
cut off the poor sailors. It gave us all cold<span class="pagenum" id="Page_156">[156]</span>
shivers. We had thought the Kapuans were
just good-natured children, and we found
them heartless, brutal savages.&mdash;Excuse me,
Mary,&#8221; he apologized. &#8220;I&#8217;m not inventing
now. That&#8217;s the plain truth. When your
people get really excited you ain&#8217;t civilized.
You&#8217;re a lot of Apache Indians on the war-path.</p>

<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t know what would have happened
if the hurricane hadn&#8217;t come at that time.
We found ourselves all on the beach and our
ships wrecks. Over a hundred or more sailors
were drowned, and the natives, both Kataafa
and Samasese, came and risked their lives
many times to save us out there clinging to
the wreckage. Mighty near every man saved
owed his life to the natives. That sort of
patched things up. We lived ashore for several
months, and every one was as friendly as
you please. You wouldn&#8217;t have known there
ever had been a war.</p>

<p>&#8220;Lots of things, I reckon,&#8221; he added finally,
&#8220;have happened since I have been away, but
what makes me laugh is to see the Herzovinians
falling all over themselves to make
friends with this Kataafa, and we, who were<span class="pagenum" id="Page_157">[157]</span>
his best friends then, falling all over ourselves
to call him all the bad names we can think of.</p>

<p>&#8220;It all goes to prove, Bill, and you can take
this from me without any sugar,&#8221; O&#8217;Neil exclaimed,
&#8220;that friendships among natives are
only good business deals. There ain&#8217;t no sentiment
mixed up in it.</p>

<p>&#8220;What&#8217;s all that row about out there?&#8221;
O&#8217;Neil suddenly exclaimed, rising and going
in haste to look out. He saw several native
policemen grasping firmly a thin white man
who was protesting vigorously.</p>

<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s Missi Stump,&#8221; Mary Hamilton cried
aghast. &#8220;What is Johnny Upolu arresting
him for?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m going to find out,&#8221; O&#8217;Neil said determinedly.
He did not like to see a white
man in the clutch of the natives. To O&#8217;Neil&#8217;s
mind it lowered all the whites in the eyes of
the Kapuans to permit such a thing as this.</p>

<p>Before Johnny Upolu and his two assistants
could recover from the onslaught, the
big sailor, followed closely by one a little
smaller but as impetuous, had attacked their
captive, and the policemen were sitting in the
sandy road.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_158">[158]</span>Johnny scowled darkly. A crowd had
gathered, and like all crowds the Kapuans at
once sided against the officers of the law, and
were making insulting remarks to the discomfited
chief of police.</p>

<p>&#8220;What do you mean by arresting an innocent
man?&#8221; O&#8217;Neil exclaimed when Johnny
Upolu had risen to his feet. &#8220;What&#8217;s this
island coming to, anyway? Now, you just
beat it.&#8221;</p>

<p>Johnny coaxed a smile upon his face.</p>

<p>&#8220;Got a warrant,&#8221; he said, producing a large
certificate and showing it to O&#8217;Neil and the
crowd.</p>

<p>O&#8217;Neil glanced contemptuously at the official
paper. He could not read a word, but he
recognized the design of the seal.</p>

<p>&#8220;Take that out to Kataafa at Kulinuu,&#8221;
O&#8217;Neil said. &#8220;That don&#8217;t go here. You&#8217;ve
got to have either a lion or another breed of
bird on your warrant to do business with us.&#8221;</p>

<p>O&#8217;Neil considered the matter settled. His
arm linked under that of Stump, they re&euml;ntered
the house. The chief of police did not
follow. An American sailorman on liberty
was, to his mind, a dangerous object to meddle<span class="pagenum" id="Page_159">[159]</span>
with. It was a kind of explosive mixture
which might go off upon contact.</p>

<p>O&#8217;Neil had never met Stump, but he sized
him up as accurately as if he had been personally
acquainted.</p>

<p>&#8220;You&#8217;re from the &#8216;Talofa,&#8217;&#8221; O&#8217;Neil said as
Mary called for more cocoanuts and Stump
composed his ruffled garments. &#8220;Why ain&#8217;t
you in her now? She&#8217;s off on a pleasure
cruise with a foreign nobleman.&#8221;</p>

<p>Stump wagged his head knowingly. &#8220;The
&#8216;Talofa&#8217; ain&#8217;t the breed to go on any pleasure
cruise,&#8221; he answered. &#8220;&#8216;Bully&#8217; Scott&#8217;s got
something on board that he didn&#8217;t just like to
put ashore in Ukula. I&#8217;ve been hiding in the
&#8216;bush.&#8217; I saw her go, so I started to find our
consul to get my rights.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Who&#8217;s been abusing you except Johnny
Upolu?&#8221; O&#8217;Neil asked. &#8220;Your countenance
does look as if it had met a hard round object.
Who did it?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;&#8216;Bully&#8217; Scott,&#8221; Stump replied bitterly.
&#8220;But I&#8217;m quit of him now. He&#8217;ll never get
me on his ship again if I can help it.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Stop swinging all over the compass,&#8221; O&#8217;Neil
said rebukingly, &#8220;and steady down on some<span class="pagenum" id="Page_160">[160]</span>
course. We want to hear what you got to
say.&#8221;</p>

<p>Stump laughed a mirthless laugh. &#8220;That&#8217;s
what I did,&#8221; he exclaimed. &#8220;I steered her
into Ukula when old man Scott thought he
was heading straight for Saluafata. Fixed
the compass, you see. Oh, it&#8217;s a great trick.&#8221;</p>

<p>O&#8217;Neil began to understand. &#8220;So Scott
didn&#8217;t intend coming in here last night?&#8221; he
asked.</p>

<p>&#8220;Not he,&#8221; Stump declared joyfully. &#8220;He
was loaded with &#8216;blacks&#8217; and guns.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s where you&#8217;re dead wrong, then,&#8221;
O&#8217;Neil explained, &#8220;for he has landed everything
and a foreign count has hired the
schooner.&#8221;</p>

<p>Stump gazed in wonder at the speaker.</p>

<p>&#8220;You don&#8217;t seem to know &#8216;Bully&#8217; Scott,&#8221;
he said. &#8220;Them guns are in the schooner
and he&#8217;s going to land them to-night at Saluafata.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Come with me,&#8221; O&#8217;Neil commanded taking
Stump by the arm. &#8220;You ought to
know if any one does. What we&#8217;ve got to do
is to put our captain wise at once. Is Scott
an Englishman?&#8221; O&#8217;Neil asked.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_161">[161]</span>&#8220;Not he!&#8221; Stump exclaimed. &#8220;He&#8217;s an
American. Comes from &#8216;Frisco&#8217;; and the
&#8216;Talofa&#8217; was stolen at Hongkong from a
Chinaman.&#8221;</p>

<p>As they passed Klinger&#8217;s store, Stump
stopped to eye the boxes still piled on the
porch of the store.</p>

<p>He shook his head as he continued behind
the two men-of-war&#8217;s men. &#8220;Nope, them guns
must be on the schooner,&#8221; he said to himself.</p>

<p>At the landing they met the two midshipmen,
who had returned from their picnic and
were waiting to return to the &#8220;Sitka.&#8221;</p>

<p>O&#8217;Neil explained the situation.</p>

<p>Johnny Upolu had followed his liberated
captive at a safe distance, and now seeing the
two officers, respectfully approached, holding
out the warrant to Phil, and indicating Stump
with his finger.</p>

<p>The lad examined it carefully.</p>

<p>&#8220;What has he done?&#8221; Phil inquired.
&#8220;This warrant must be respected, anyway.&#8221;
He turned to Stump. &#8220;I&#8217;ll see the captain
at once, and you being an American, he will
ask to have you released if you have committed
no crime.&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_162">[162]</span>Johnny Upolu put his hand on the prisoner&#8217;s
shoulder and led him quietly toward
the jail. A few yards had been traveled when
Stump stopped and called.</p>

<p>&#8220;May I speak to you a moment, sir, in
private?&#8221;</p>

<p>Phil joined him, and the policeman moved
away a few feet.</p>

<p>&#8220;Keep these here things for me,&#8221; he said.
&#8220;You can show &#8217;em to your skipper.&#8221;</p>

<p>Phil received a package of soiled letters and
put them into his pocket.</p>

<p>Upon arrival on board the midshipmen
went at once to Commander Tazewell&#8217;s cabin.
They found him deep in thought.</p>

<p>&#8220;I have just left the consul&#8217;s house,&#8221; the commander
said after waving the lads to seats. &#8220;He
tells me all the natives believe that the guns
have been landed. The Herzovinian consul
a few days ago said he would help to prevent
a war, and to-day he writes to the American
and English consul that he must reserve his
decision until Judge Lindsay has given his
judgment. Kataafa was summoned by Judge
Lindsay to appear before him at one o&#8217;clock
to-day and he deliberately waited two hours<span class="pagenum" id="Page_163">[163]</span>
before he appeared, a Kapuan way of showing
his independence. It all looks ominous,&#8221; he
added ruefully.</p>

<p>Phil began at once to tell of the native council
at Jumping Rock and the &#8220;tonga-fiti&#8221; decided
for that night. He also called in O&#8217;Neil,
who had been waiting outside the cabin, and
that worthy told in picturesque language the
story of Stump.</p>

<p>&#8220;Here are some letters this man Stump
gave me, and said I could show them to you,
sir,&#8221; Phil said after O&#8217;Neil had completed his
narrative.</p>

<p>Commander Tazewell examined the much
soiled and torn correspondence, while the
lads and O&#8217;Neil waited in silent interest to
learn of their purport.</p>

<p>&#8220;These corroborate the very thing I have
been anxious to prove,&#8221; Commander Tazewell
exclaimed joyfully. &#8220;Scott&#8217;s a full fledged
American. He cleared from Suva in the Fiji
under the American flag. There&#8217;s the paper,&#8221;
handing to Phil an English colonial document.
&#8220;What&#8217;s this?&mdash;a clipping from an English
paper,&#8221; he added wonderingly. &#8220;Schooner
&#8216;Ta-Li&#8217; stolen by a Yankee pirate.&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_164">[164]</span>&#8220;Stump said Captain Scott had stolen the
&#8216;Talofa&#8217; in Hongkong,&#8221; O&#8217;Neil said quietly.</p>

<p>Commander Tazewell glanced quickly over
the remaining letters.</p>

<p>&#8220;Stump has brought us the evidence too
late,&#8221; he said disappointedly, spreading out a
letter on his desk. &#8220;The guns are paid for,&#8221;
he read aloud. &#8220;Godfried and Company, our
agents, will load them upon demand from
you. Remember, you take them to Saluafata
at night and send word to me on arrival.&#8221;
Commander Tazewell stopped reading, and
gazed off wistfully. &#8220;That was from Klinger
to Scott. He&#8217;ll be unloading them to-night,&#8221;
he added, &#8220;unless they are already in the
Kapuan firm&#8217;s store. If I&#8217;d had these letters
this morning, I&#8217;d have sunk the &#8216;Talofa&#8217; before
I would have permitted her to leave the
harbor, foreign flag and all, until after I had
given the vessel a thorough search.&#8221;</p>

<small>RUMORS OF WAR</small></h2>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">Commander Tazewell</span> and the midshipmen
dined that evening with Mr. Lee and
his daughters.</p>

<p>&#8220;The evidence is all in, commander,&#8221; the
American consul said as the party sought the
cool sea breeze on the &#8220;lanai,&#8221;<a id="FNanchor_24" href="#Footnote_24" class="fnanchor">[24]</a> facing the
harbor. &#8220;The chief justice will probably
render his decision in the morning.&#8221;</p>

<p>Tazewell expressed his gratification.</p>

<p>&#8220;And the Herzovinian consul?&#8221; he asked.
&#8220;Does he still refuse to help to prevent a
war?&#8221;</p>

<p>Mr. Lee&#8217;s face became grave.</p>

<p>&#8220;The three consuls held a meeting this
afternoon after you had gone,&#8221; he said in
reply. &#8220;The English consul and I unconditionally
agreed to support the judge&#8217;s
choice. Mr. Carlson seemed ill at ease. He<span class="pagenum" id="Page_166">[166]</span>
could not be made to give a direct answer on
any question, and all of a sudden he declared
he had an important engagement and bolted
from the room. We saw that he was under a
serious mental strain.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I see,&#8221; Commander Tazewell said quietly.
&#8220;Have you an idea what the decision will
be?&#8221; he asked.</p>

<p>Mr. Lee remained silently in thought for a
moment. &#8220;Personally no, but my confidants
among the natives all say Judge Lindsay is
against Kataafa. I know the judge to be an
honorable and unbiased man,&#8221; he added in
defense of his friend. &#8220;That we Americans
are inclined in our sympathies for Panu would
have no influence with him at all. This unimpeachable
testimony of the demand made
some years ago by Herzovinia and Kataafa&#8217;s
recent discourtesy to the court in keeping the
judge waiting, besides practically refusing to
agree to abide by the judge&#8217;s decision, may influence
a judgment against him.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Then Carlson must have received instructions
to uphold the judge&#8217;s decision, only in
case it is favorable to Kataafa,&#8221; the commander
said. &#8220;Now that it appears to be<span class="pagenum" id="Page_167">[167]</span>
going against him, he refuses to stand with
you and your British colleague.&#8221;</p>

<p>Mr. Lee nodded his head. &#8220;That seems to
be the one possible solution.&#8221;</p>

<p>Commander Tazewell had given the consul
that morning a full account of the &#8220;Talofa.&#8221;
Now he brought up the subject of the meeting
of the Panu warriors and their &#8220;tonga-fiti.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I had at first thought to advise Tuamana
against any action by the Panu warriors,&#8221;
Commander Tazewell said, &#8220;but on second
thoughts I decided it was better to keep my
hands off and trust it to you. If those boxes
landed from the &#8216;Talofa&#8217; do contain guns,
they ought to be seized, but not by natives,
even though they say they will turn them
over to the judge.&#8221; Mr. Lee nodded his
agreement with the sentiment.</p>

<p>&#8220;As soon as I got your note telling me of
the &#8216;tonga-fiti,&#8217;&#8221; Mr. Lee replied, &#8220;I went at
once to Tuamana. I advised him against action.
You see, commander,&#8221; Mr. Lee declared
earnestly, &#8220;a forcible entry into the Kapuan
firm&#8217;s store will bring the Herzovinian sailors
ashore to protect their property.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Good. I&#8217;m glad you saw Tuamana,&#8221;<span class="pagenum" id="Page_168">[168]</span>
Commander Tazewell assured him. &#8220;And he
agreed to carry out your wish?&#8221; he asked.</p>

<p>&#8220;He listened very patiently and seemed to
agree,&#8221; Mr. Lee said. &#8220;Then he told me that
he now knew the guns were not at the store,
but still on the &#8216;Talofa&#8217; and were to be landed
to-night at Saluafata.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;That is what this man Stump also claims,&#8221;
the commander exclaimed. &#8220;By the way,
thank you for your promptness in having the
poor fellow released. O&#8217;Neil has him in
charge on board the &#8216;Sitka.&#8217;&#8221;</p>

<p>While the consul and the commander discussed
the affairs of the nations, the young
people had gone to the landing, where O&#8217;Neil
had brought the sailing launch, its sails spread
and flapping in the gentle breeze.</p>

<p>Miss Lee had brought her banjo and Avao,
who joined them, held an Hawaiian &#8220;ukalele,&#8221;
a small guitar with only three strings. As the
sail filled and the launch gathered way, their
young voices charmed the night with a variety
of plaintive Kapuan songs. Several canoes
with both men and women natives, paddling
lazily across the bay, joined in the songs. It
seemed like fairyland to the midshipmen.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_169">[169]</span>They sailed around the men-of-war in turn,
serenading; then shaped their course for
Kulinuu Point on the western side of Ukula.</p>

<p>&#8220;What do you know new?&#8221; Phil asked
Alice during a lull in the music.</p>

<p>&#8220;That the guns are to be landed from the
&#8216;Talofa&#8217; at Saluafata to-morrow, and that
Kataafa leaves Kulinuu with all his people to-night,&#8221;
she replied.</p>

<p>&#8220;Where did you hear this?&#8221; he asked wonderingly.</p>

<p>&#8220;Avao told me, but every one in Ukula
knows it,&#8221; she answered. &#8220;There&#8217;s no difficulty
learning secrets. No secrets are kept.
The difficulty is to recognize a secret from a
trick.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;What do you mean?&#8221; Phil inquired, mystified.</p>

<p>Alice laughed lightly thrumming the cords
of the &#8220;ukalele&#8221; Avao had relinquished.</p>

<p>&#8220;When you have a secret which you know
will be found out before you can act,&#8221; she explained,
&#8220;why, you deliberately spread a lot
of rumors which will confuse your enemies.
I have heard that the arms were to be landed
at Vaileli, and that Klinger had said he was<span class="pagenum" id="Page_170">[170]</span>
going there. That Kataafa was going to Saluafata
and also Melie. That the arms were already
in Kulinuu. That the arms were on
the Herzovinian war-ship and would be given
to Kataafa at Saluafata to-morrow, and that
the arms were in the boxes on the porch of the
Kapuan firm&#8217;s store.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Well,&#8221; Phil exclaimed, &#8220;that is rather
confusing. And you decided that the arms
would be landed in Saluafata?&#8221;</p>

<p>Alice nodded. &#8220;I was all this afternoon at
the &#8216;lookout&#8217; on Mission Hill,&#8221; she said. &#8220;I
saw the &#8216;Talofa&#8217; far out on the horizon, her
hull invisible, only the top of her masts in
sight. With this breeze she could have
gone out of sight. She&#8217;s waiting for darkness.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;And Kataafa is leaving Kulinuu to-night?&#8221;
Phil asked.</p>

<p>&#8220;I got that from Mary Hamilton,&#8221; she answered.
&#8220;Klinger&#8217;s wife is from Saluafata.
Her father is the chief of that village. She
came to Ukula this morning from the Vaileli
plantation where Klinger ordinarily lives.
She left in a canoe for Saluafata.&#8221;</p>

<p>Phil gazed in wonder at the slim girl beside<span class="pagenum" id="Page_171">[171]</span>
him. &#8220;You&#8217;re a marvel,&#8221; he exclaimed admiringly.</p>

<p>Alice smiled. &#8220;I love to work things out,&#8221;
she acknowledged. &#8220;You men seem so incapable,
while the motives of the natives are
really so easy to follow.&#8221;</p>

<p>The boat was sailing near Kulinuu Point.
Phil glanced across the intervening water.</p>

<p>&#8220;Let&#8217;s land and walk home,&#8221; he said to
Alice. All agreed readily.</p>

<p>A passing canoe was called alongside the
deep draft launch and the passengers quickly
transferred.</p>

<p>&#8220;All right, O&#8217;Neil,&#8221; Phil said. &#8220;You may
return to the ship. We&#8217;ll go back to town on
foot.&#8221;</p>

<p>They landed on the pebbly beach and
walked across to the main street leading between
the double row of royal palm trees. It
was a deserted village. Every one had departed.</p>

<p>Avao found an old woman crooning in the
corner of a house and asked her a question.</p>

<p>The old hag recognized her and turned upon
her fiercely.</p>

<p>At the Kapuan firm&#8217;s store, on their way<span class="pagenum" id="Page_172">[172]</span>
home, the party again stopped. Avao&#8217;s quick
eye caught the gleam of metal from the porch.
She deliberately walked forward until a challenge
brought her to a stop. Phil saw a
Herzovinian sailor, gun leveled, walk toward
the girl, who was standing stock-still several
paces from the steps.</p>

<p>The challenge had brought several more
sailors to the door. Many natives, living in
houses in the surrounding bush, quickly gathered,
and their childish curiosity pressed them
forward. Before five minutes had elapsed a
crowd of nearly fifty warriors and maidens
were surrounding the front of the store; and
as their number swelled, the crowd grew more
bold and advanced toward the house. The
sailors stood their ground with guns held
ready.</p>

<p>&#8220;This is awkward,&#8221; Phil exclaimed excitedly
to Sydney. &#8220;Something&#8217;s got to be
done at once or we&#8217;ll have the &#8216;tonga-fiti&#8217; after
all. Follow me.&#8221; He advanced, pushing his
way through the crowd. The midshipmen
were in uniform, and the natives gave way
readily before them. Phil had almost reached
Avao&#8217;s side, when a loud report of a rifle<span class="pagenum" id="Page_173">[173]</span>
discharged brought him to a stand. Several
more shots were then fired in rapid succession.
The natives instantly backed away; but
when they found no one had been hurt they
stopped and began talking and gesticulating
wildly.</p>

<p>Phil seized Avao by the arm and turned
quickly back toward the road.</p>

<p>From out on the water a rocket soared into
the sky.</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, of all the mysteries,&#8221; Phil exclaimed
as they hurried back toward the consulate.
&#8220;I wonder if the guns are in that store after
all?&#8221;</p>

<p>At the landing the Herzovinian cutters
were beginning to arrive as Phil and his
party passed. They saw a company of sailors
with two officers quickly form and move at
double time up the road.</p>

<p>The lads soon saw Commander Tazewell
and the American consul hurrying toward
the town.</p>

<p>&#8220;What has happened?&#8221; Commander Tazewell
demanded of Phil as they met.</p>

<p>Phil breathlessly explained. &#8220;I suppose
the war-ship thought it was an attack,&#8221; he<span class="pagenum" id="Page_174">[174]</span>
ended. &#8220;But why are the guards there at
all unless the guns are in the store and
not on board the schooner? Kulinuu is deserted,&#8221;
he added. &#8220;We landed there and
walked home.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Kataafa probably has the guns by now,&#8221;
Commander Tazewell said to the consul in a low
voice which Phil could barely hear. &#8220;Is this a
plan to trick us into committing ourselves before
the chief justice&#8217;s decision is rendered?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;There&#8217;s no need of our going further, commander,&#8221;
the consul said, nervously regarding
his daughters with a fond eye and fearful of
danger to them. &#8220;Come back with me. We
can talk more privately.&#8221;</p>

<p>A figure proceeding from the landing was
soon recognized as the British captain.</p>

<p>He was given a full account of the incident,
and appeared very much relieved.</p>

<p>&#8220;When I heard the shots and the answering
rocket from the war-ship,&#8221; he exclaimed, &#8220;I
at once imagined that Kataafa was attacking
Ukula. I have my men ready and the
boats lowered,&#8221; he added. &#8220;Thought I&#8217;d come
ashore to look about first. I was going to
camp them in the British consul&#8217;s yard.&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_175">[175]</span>The party, with the exception of Avao,
returned to the American consulate. The
&#8220;Tapau,&#8221; with an innocent smile and a
cheery &#8220;Talofa, Alii,&#8221;<a id="FNanchor_25" href="#Footnote_25" class="fnanchor">[25]</a> slipped away by a
&#8220;bush&#8221; trail.</p>

<p>&#8220;What we need, Tazewell,&#8221; the British
captain declared as the &#8220;lanai&#8221; was reached
and all were seated quietly, &#8220;is information.
We must send out scouts and find out where
this Kataafa has gone and what that fellow
Klinger is up to. Our mysterious count,&#8221; he
added, &#8220;is not out purely for pleasure.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I have been thinking over a plan,&#8221; Commander
Tazewell replied. &#8220;This Captain Scott
is an American citizen and is sailing under
the Herzovinian flag. His mate, Stump, who
deserted him, has given us evidence that he
came into Ukula with &#8216;blacks&#8217; for the Kapuan
firm and guns for Klinger. All circumstances
seem to show that we shall find everything
we are searching for at Saluafata. That&#8217;s the
Herzovinian port, leased to their government,
and I dare not send there to arrest him. But
I can send a party by land to observe and
bring us news.&#8221;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_176">[176]</span>&#8220;Right-oh!&#8221; the British captain agreed.
&#8220;I think I&#8217;ll send my steam pinnace to fish
along the edge of the reef toward Saluafata.
There&#8217;s rare fishing there. Have you ever
trolled for these big Kapuan bonitos, using
pearl-shell hooks?&#8221; he asked. &#8220;I have a
lieutenant who is keen on it.&#8221;</p>

<p>Preparations were made at once for an
early start on the morrow. The distance to
Saluafata by trail was about fifteen miles,
and by water scarcely ten. A code of signals
was decided upon to facilitate communication
between the American land party and the
British steam launch. Mr. Lee took upon
himself the supply of ponies. The two midshipmen
and O&#8217;Neil were selected by Commander
Tazewell to go.</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll send them openly,&#8221; Commander Tazewell
said, as the naval officers rose to take
their departure from the consulate; &#8220;in uniform,
of course.&#8221;</p>

<p>Alice Lee endeavored in vain to win her
father&#8217;s permission to go along with the midshipmen.
&#8220;I may be able to help them,&#8221;
she declared. &#8220;I know the trail and speak
Kapuan.&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_177">[177]</span>The midshipmen and O&#8217;Neil were on the
dock at an early hour the next day. There
they found three intelligent little ponies
waiting them. Phil carried a sketch chart
of the road to be taken.</p>

<p>As they passed through the Matautu district
of Ukula, they caught a glimpse of
Alice&#8217;s wistful face gazing upon them from
the porch of the consulate. She waved them
a good-bye, while all three raised their caps
in return.</p>

<p>&#8220;She&#8217;s a plucky girl,&#8221; Sydney exclaimed,
&#8220;but I feel more free without a girl along.
We can&#8217;t tell; there may be a chance for a
fight before we get back.&#8221;</p>

<p>O&#8217;Neil chuckled. &#8220;No fear,&#8221; he said. &#8220;A
Kapuan wouldn&#8217;t raise his finger against a
naval officer. Unless,&#8221; he added grimly, &#8220;these
scheming white traders put them up to it.&#8221;</p>

<p>The trail was none too good for their ponies
and the going was slow. At the village of
Tangali they stopped and got a black boy, a
laborer on a near-by plantation, to gather for
them a few green cocoanuts. The boy readily
climbed a tall slender tree with the agility of
a monkey.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_178">[178]</span>&#8220;All he requires is a tail,&#8221; Phil said as the
black boy dropped the fruit into their hands
and then came rapidly down to receive his
reward.</p>

<p>At the next village, Paulei, which was
deserted, as was the former town, of all except
old women and children, O&#8217;Neil pointed
out the very spot where the American Captain
O&#8217;Malley had tricked the Herzovinian war-ship
in its attempt to bombard the Kataafa
warriors nearly a decade ago.</p>

<p>&#8220;He knew to the king&#8217;s taste how to handle
a foreigner, and they all liked him for it too,&#8221;
he exclaimed admiringly.</p>

<p>&#8220;The Irish have a way with &#8217;em,&#8221; Sydney
said, smiling broadly.</p>

<p>&#8220;Not at all, sir,&#8221; the sailor replied. The
joke apparently passed him by without notice,
except for a comical deprecating glance at its
author. &#8220;He couldn&#8217;t be bluffed and was always
on the job. If it hadn&#8217;t been for him
the Herzovinian flag would be flying over
these islands to-day.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Maybe it would be a good thing,&#8221; Phil said,
and Sydney agreed quickly, to lead O&#8217;Neil on.</p>

<p>&#8220;It ain&#8217;t the islands, sir; that ain&#8217;t what&#8217;s<span class="pagenum" id="Page_179">[179]</span>
making me want to see the foreigners get left,&#8221;
O&#8217;Neil explained. &#8220;It&#8217;s the way they go
about trying to get &#8217;em.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I suppose, O&#8217;Neil,&#8221; Sydney interjected,
&#8220;that you think it would have been more
gentlemanly and in keeping with the dignity
of a great country to just take them and let
the British and Americans like it or lump it
as they pleased.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Exactly so, sir,&#8221; O&#8217;Neil declared. &#8220;That&#8217;s
the way I figure it ought to be done.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s because you&#8217;re Irish, O&#8217;Neil,&#8221; Phil
told him jokingly. &#8220;The Irish always seize
the government. When they can&#8217;t control it,
they&#8217;re against it. The nation that gets these
islands,&#8221; he added, &#8220;desires to be right before
the world. To do so she must have a very
good excuse to seize them. All three nations
would be glad to take an option on the
group, but when one appears to be gaining
ground, the other two combine against
her.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s it exactly, Mr. Perry,&#8221; O&#8217;Neil exclaimed.
&#8220;But Herzovinia is gaining among
the natives. Even though they are taking
their land, they are making money for the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_180">[180]</span>
natives. The Americans and English are
standing in the way of Kapuan prosperity.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;If one nation owned these islands by
itself, it could make them a paradise,&#8221; Sydney
exclaimed enthusiastically. &#8220;I have never
seen such magnificent country in my life. It
seems a natural garden, and back there on the
mountains,&#8221; he added, glancing toward Mount
Lautu with its crater-shaped summit, &#8220;they
say are the finest and most valuable hard
wood trees in the world.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You may be sure,&#8221; O&#8217;Neil confided, &#8220;Herzovinia
is going to get this island. A statesman,
way back in the eighties, wrote that in
his note-book and every one of them &#8216;savvys&#8217;<a id="FNanchor_26" href="#Footnote_26" class="fnanchor">[26]</a>
the plan and is pulling for it. If we just set
our eyes on the other island, Kulila, with the
harbor shaped like a shoe, called Tua-Tua,
and give up our share in this one, England
would have to pull stakes and get out.&#8221;</p>

<p>Both midshipmen laughed. &#8220;We might
have known O&#8217;Neil would be against the
English,&#8221; Sydney said.</p>

<p>&#8220;What has England ever done for the
Irish?&#8221; O&#8217;Neil replied defensively.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_181">[181]</span>The three horsemen crossed two fair sized
streams, stopping to allow their ponies to
plunge their hot noses deep into the cool
mountain water. From the next hill the
harbor of Saluafata opened out before them.</p>

<p>&#8220;There&#8217;s the &#8216;Talofa,&#8217;&#8221; Sydney cried joyfully.
They searched the ocean for the steam
launch, but the land and trees shut out the
view to the westward.</p>

<p>&#8220;Hark!&#8221; O&#8217;Neil exclaimed. They listened.
From below them the faint music of singing
came up to them. &#8220;There&#8217;s where the people
are, down there,&#8221; he added.</p>

<p>&#8220;War canoes,&#8221; O&#8217;Neil said pointing. The
beach was hidden by the foliage, but as O&#8217;Neil
spoke several large canoes had suddenly appeared,
being propelled swiftly alongside the
anchored schooner.</p>

<p>Phil urged his horse onward.</p>

<p>&#8220;Excuse me, sir,&#8221; O&#8217;Neil exclaimed nervously.
&#8220;Those glasses you have there,&#8221; indicating
a pair of ship&#8217;s binoculars Phil wore
slung over his shoulders, &#8220;will give us all the
information we want without going any
further into the lion&#8217;s mouth.&#8221;</p>

<p>Phil gazed upon the sailor in surprise.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_182">[182]</span>&#8220;Do you think there is danger in riding
down there?&#8221; he asked.</p>

<p>O&#8217;Neil hesitated. &#8220;That depends,&#8221; he answered
thoughtfully.</p>

<p>&#8220;Upon what?&#8221; Sydney insisted.</p>

<p>&#8220;Upon what the white men who are fixing
this show intend doing,&#8221; the sailor said.</p>

<p>&#8220;We can&#8217;t turn back now,&#8221; Phil declared.
&#8220;It would look as if we were afraid.&#8221;</p>

<p>O&#8217;Neil nodded. &#8220;I guess you&#8217;re right, Mr.
Perry,&#8221; the boatswain&#8217;s mate replied grimly.
He knew from experience the danger in appearing
before an army of armed warriors,
who have been keyed to the highest pitch of
savage excitement.</p>

<p>The three horsemen urged their steeds forward
and descended the hill road leading
down to the populous town of Saluafata.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER XI<br />


<small>HIGH CHIEF KATAAFA</small></h2>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">Klinger,</span> after leaving Kataafa and his
chiefs at Kulinuu, took the trail leading behind
the town of Ukula. He desired if possible
to keep his movements secret, although
he felt sure that before long it would be unnecessary.
The movement of the Kataafa warriors
by both land and sea must be seen by
the natives of the other faction.</p>

<p>As he gave his pony his head, he dwelt
happily upon the success that had so far attended
his efforts.</p>

<p>The manager and his native companions
stopped at every village en route. They
found the warriors collected ready to hear
his words. Then after he had ridden on, the
entire village made ready to follow afoot or
in canoes within the barrier reef.</p>

<p>It was long past midnight before he reached
the village of Saluafata. His native companions
left him, and he entered a large native<span class="pagenum" id="Page_184">[184]</span>
house built off by itself overlooking the bay
and but a few hundred yards from the beach.</p>

<p>A native woman, comely and dignified in
European costume, met him at the door.</p>

<p>&#8220;&#8216;Talofa&#8217;s&#8217; not in?&#8221; he asked in Kapuan.</p>

<p>On the table a cold supper was waiting
him. After eating, he stood for several minutes
gazing upon the dark waters of the bay.</p>

<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t wake me until the schooner anchors,&#8221;
he said to the woman who was then clearing
away the remnants of his meal. &#8220;My bed
ready? I&#8217;m dead sleepy.&#8221;</p>

<p>After Klinger had gone to his room the
woman took her master&#8217;s clothes and proceeded
to the little stream a few hundred
yards up the beach. There she began to
wash the soiled garments. As the day
dawned the settlement commenced to awaken
from its slumber. Fishermen launched their
canoes, paddling out to the reef to seek for
shell-fish. Native woman after woman appeared,
squatting down in the shallow brook
to cleanse her own and her husband&#8217;s slender
wardrobe. A babble of musical voices rose
above the noise of the brook and the distant
thunder of the surf on the reef.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_185">[185]</span>&#8220;Missi Klinger come?&#8221; asked one woman
as she noticed in the early morning light the
clothes being washed by Klinger&#8217;s wife.</p>

<p>Fanua nodded joyfully. She was very proud
of being the wife of the manager of the Kapuan
firm. She was a comely woman, much
younger than Klinger, but the first bloom of
youth had vanished. There yet remained a
certain charm of movement. Every gesture
was full of grace, the effect of her long training
as the Tapau<a id="FNanchor_27" href="#Footnote_27" class="fnanchor">[27]</a> of Saluafata, where,
until Klinger married her, she had led the
village in all its dances and processions.</p>

<p>The throng of women continued to increase.
All plied questions to the smiling Fanua, who
answered them all good-naturedly.</p>

<p>When would Kataafa arrive? What was
going to happen? Had the chief justice said
who was to be king? Could they go ahead and
build their new house? Was there to be war?
Would the islands be taken by Herzovinia?</p>

<p>The women of Kapua are the source of all
gossip. Nothing can be kept secret from their
intelligent intellects. Nor can any of them<span class="pagenum" id="Page_186">[186]</span>
keep a secret an instant. It is their stock in
trade. As they washed, as they beat out the
tapa cloth, as they wove the sennit string
from cocoanut fiber, as they gathered the
thatch for the roofs of their houses, or as they
swept clean their houses and adjoining space,
their voices were always raised to gossip with
their nearest neighbors. Nothing missed their
watchful eyes. News travels fast. An incident
happens in one village and in an incredibly
short time the news has been passed
from house to house and village to village
until the whole island has buzzed with the
knowledge.</p>

<p>The sun had been up several hours when
the &#8220;Talofa&#8221; crawled slowly through the
narrow entrance to the harbor, between the
reefs, and anchored scarcely a stone&#8217;s throw
from the shore.</p>

<p>The rattle of her chain awoke Klinger. He
arose at once. Fanua was at work preparing
breakfast. He watched in silence from the
window. He saw a boat lowered and shortly
shove off for the beach. It grounded in front
of his house. He waved a greeting. The
count and Captain Scott stepped ashore.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_187">[187]</span>Fanua welcomed them at the door with the
musical Kapuan salutation &#8220;Talofa, Alii,&#8221; and
then hastened away to finish preparing the
breakfast with her own hands, a duty never
entrusted to another.</p>

<p>&#8220;Your wife?&#8221; the count asked. Klinger
nodded, but his hasty flush told plainly that
the acknowledgment was a slight mortification
before this superior gentleman.</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m here for life,&#8221; he replied, as if he
deemed it necessary to explain. &#8220;Kapua is
no place for a woman of our race to live, and
I needed a companion. I was lonely. Fanua
is a queen, in spite of her brown skin.&#8221;</p>

<p>The count put out his hand in ready sympathy.
Klinger took it gratefully, and no
more was said.</p>

<p>&#8220;Did you get that hound, Ben Stump?&#8221;
Captain Scott asked eagerly after a short
silence.</p>

<p>Klinger nodded. &#8220;The chief of police was
after him. He&#8217;ll be found unless he left
Ukula.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;He took with him some papers,&#8221; Scott
explained. &#8220;I didn&#8217;t find it out until a few
minutes before we sailed, and the count would<span class="pagenum" id="Page_188">[188]</span>
not wait. Have you any one you can trust to
send back to get them? If the American
man-of-war captain reads them before I get
clear of these islands, it&#8217;s all over with me
and the &#8216;Talofa.&#8217;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;We&#8217;ll have you clear in short order now,&#8221;
Klinger encouraged. &#8220;Have you breakfasted?&#8221;</p>

<p>The count and Scott declined to partake of
the tempting food set before them. Klinger
ate hurriedly, his wife serving him, while the
count and Scott walked to the door, from
whence they looked out upon the increasingly
busy scene. The village of Saluafata
was being invaded from all directions by the
followers of Kataafa. They were arriving by
road, long lines of almost naked warriors and
half clad women, and the beach was already
crowded with the canoes of those who had
come by water. Each village as it arrived
selected its own spot for preparation.</p>

<p>Klinger soon joined his companions. Such
gatherings of the natives were old stories to
both Klinger and Captain Scott, but to the
count the sight was one of absorbing interest.</p>

<p>Kataafa himself and his more important<span class="pagenum" id="Page_189">[189]</span>
chiefs were in the &#8220;Malae,&#8221; or public square
of the village, when the three papalangi arrived
there.</p>

<p>The greeting between the wily old Kapuan
rebel and the count was ceremonial to an extreme.
Klinger had previously made it plain
that this &#8220;papalangi&#8221; was the special ambassador
of his great nation beyond the sea&mdash;a
nation which was much more powerful than
both England and America put together.</p>

<p>The would-be king made the count sit next
to him, and then the ceremony of kava drinking
was begun. This solemn custom of preparing
the root and mixing the kava can
never be dispensed with at any ceremony in
which the Kapuans take part. To omit it
would be a grave ceremonial blunder.</p>

<p>Kataafa and his important chiefs and their
women sat under the spreading branches of
an umbrella tree, whose horizontal boughs
covered with dark green foliage gave shelter
from the scorching sun to nearly two hundred
men and women. The warriors sat in serried
ranks, close to their chosen king, while the
women fringed the edge of the densely packed
crowd.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_190">[190]</span>The various villages formed their companies
where they had camped upon arrival, and
very soon they could be heard approaching.
Faint singing was heard in the distance, becoming
stronger as the groups advanced. At
last the war chant burst out in all its barbaric
melody. The maidens led, two abreast, their
Tapau in front, dressed in her most elaborate
creation of fine mats, tapa and girdles of
sweet-scented grass. Her skin, shiny with
oil, resembling soft satin, and her locks polished
to the deep bluish black of the raven&#8217;s
wing. Upon her head rested grotesquely the
Tapau head-dress of human hair and shells
of pearl. Around her throat were string after
string of shells and beads. Following the
maidens came the warriors, each carrying a
staff to represent a rifle.</p>

<p>As each village arrived they danced wildly,
keeping time to their quick, inspiring chant,
the women, led by their graceful Tapau, swaying
from side to side in perfect time, while the
men brandished their wooden guns, in pantomime
of battle.</p>

<p>Then the villagers with a sudden burst of
throaty sound, resembling the final roar of a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_191">[191]</span>
wave dashing upon the reef, deposited their
food offerings and withdrew to their appointed
places, from where they would take part in the
great &#8220;fono,&#8221;<a id="FNanchor_28" href="#Footnote_28" class="fnanchor">[28]</a> called by their candidate for
king.</p>

<p>Count Rosen gazed in undisguised admiration
upon this wonderfully drilled assemblage.
All were now sitting immovable on the ground,
their deep lustrous eyes turned in the direction
of the inner circle of chiefs, where sat their
calm leader.</p>

<p>After several minutes of impressive silence
a chief rose to his feet and struck the attitude
traditional to the Kapuan of one who wishes
to be heard. He carried a &#8220;fui&#8221; of white
horsehair in his right hand, while his left
rested upon the knob of his orator&#8217;s staff.</p>

<p>He talked for nearly fifteen minutes, while
the multitude listened in breathless attention.</p>

<p>&#8220;He is Kataafa&#8217;s talking man,&#8221; Klinger
whispered to the count. &#8220;He has told them
that you are here to help crown their chosen
king.&#8221;</p>

<p>Captain Scott was becoming restless. These
native &#8220;fonos&#8221; he knew were often long drawn<span class="pagenum" id="Page_192">[192]</span>
out affairs. He was anxious to be free, to sail
away from the Kapuan Islands. He did not
relish being stopped by an American war-ship.</p>

<p>&#8220;Can&#8217;t you cut this short?&#8221; he asked
Klinger.</p>

<p>Klinger shook his head.</p>

<p>&#8220;There&#8217;s no danger,&#8221; he assured Scott. &#8220;I
have spies out, and when they bring me news
of any movement which may threaten us,
there will be time enough. The Kapuan cannot
be hurried in his deliberations. We must
be sure these people are all on our side before
we give them the means to accomplish our
purpose.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;How about my pay for carrying your
guns?&#8221; Scott asked.</p>

<p>Klinger nodded. &#8220;I have your check in
my pocket,&#8221; he replied quietly. Then he rose
to speak to the assemblage. His words were
eagerly heard by the chiefs, and after he had
finished the talking man in a loud liquid voice
gave Klinger&#8217;s meaning to the crowd. There
was a murmur of disapproval from several
quarters. Chiefs arose at many points in the
crowd, their talking men beside them. It was<span class="pagenum" id="Page_193">[193]</span>
considered undignified for a chief to speak for
himself.</p>

<p>Klinger&#8217;s placid face remained calm. The
count showed plainly his anxiety, while Captain
Scott smiled grimly.</p>

<p>&#8220;A little previous, I&#8217;m thinking,&#8221; Scott
said, shaking his head knowingly.</p>

<p>&#8220;What did you say to displease them?&#8221; the
count demanded of Klinger.</p>

<p>&#8220;I told them that for the support we should
give them they must refuse to trade with any
one but us, and that Herzovinia would hoist
her flag at Kulinuu to protect them from the
anger of the English and Americans.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Is that all?&#8221; the count exclaimed.</p>

<p>Klinger hesitated. &#8220;I also said that land
claims of our people must be acknowledged by
the king before the arms were given them.&#8221;</p>

<p>The count showed great displeasure.</p>

<p>&#8220;What land claims?&#8221; he asked.</p>

<p>&#8220;All claims,&#8221; Klinger replied. &#8220;The Kapuan
firm holds many miles of land claimed
by English, American and Kapuans. The
firm cannot give this land up.&#8221;</p>

<p>The count bit his lips.</p>

<p>&#8220;It must be now exacted as a condition,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_194">[194]</span>
count,&#8221; Klinger declared insistently. &#8220;To
give in upon any point would be considered
by the Kapuans a sign of weakness.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You have delayed the thing unnecessarily,&#8221;
Captain Scott growled. &#8220;They&#8217;ll
argue this point for hours.&#8221;</p>

<p>Klinger was obdurate.</p>

<p>&#8220;The harbor of Tua-Tua is one of our
claims,&#8221; he said to the count in an undertone.
&#8220;The American government succeeded
in leasing some land there for a coaling station.
That is the purpose of this condition.
The Americans must leave that harbor.&#8221;</p>

<p>The count appeared puzzled.</p>

<p>&#8220;After we have taken over the islands,&#8221; he
said, &#8220;then we could ask the American government
to give up their lease.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I have lived among these people many
years, count,&#8221; Klinger explained determinedly.
&#8220;The island of Kulila, in which is Tua-Tua,
is for the most part loyal to Panu-Mafili.
After Kataafa becomes king, he must bring
that island under control. We must help
him to take the warriors across the straits
and supply him arms and ammunition to
fight successfully against Chief Moanga, who<span class="pagenum" id="Page_195">[195]</span>
is a very formidable warrior. Otherwise we
shall not control all of the islands.&#8221;</p>

<p>While the &#8220;fono&#8221; was still in progress a
messenger arrived with information of an
important character.</p>

<p>Kataafa heard the messenger in silence.
He did not show by a single muscle that
the news displeased him.</p>

<p>&#8220;The chief justice rendered his decision
this morning,&#8221; Klinger told the count in a
whisper. &#8220;He has decided that Panu-Mafili
is the king of all Kapua, and all
who take up arms against him are declared
rebels.&#8221;</p>

<p>The news had a quieting effect upon the
natives after Kataafa&#8217;s talking man had given
it to them in his loud, eloquent words.</p>

<p>&#8220;A lucky strike,&#8221; Captain Scott exclaimed.
&#8220;Now I think they will agree.&#8221;</p>

<p>Kataafa, through his talking man, gave his
word that all the conditions made by the
Herzovinians were accepted.</p>

<p>The white men rose and left the council.
The temper of the people, as they passed out
among them, was again happy. Smiles and
hand-shakes met them on every side. The<span class="pagenum" id="Page_196">[196]</span>
war shout was begun and thundered out in
perfect time.</p>

<p>&#8220;Kataafa Tupu-e-Kapua<a id="FNanchor_29" href="#Footnote_29" class="fnanchor">[29]</a>&mdash;ah!&#8221;</p>

<p>The people had declared their willingness
to be declared rebels, and undertook to defy
the chief justice.</p>

<p>Klinger&#8217;s face shone with delight. The
first move was successful. Only one more
was necessary. Kataafa holding Ukula, while
the few weak bands of loyal natives were
driven into the bush by his well-armed cohorts,
all the enemies of the Kapuan firm
would be confounded. &#8220;So long as our consul
has the backbone to hold out against the
other two consuls,&#8221; he said aloud, &#8220;under
the treaty no action can be taken by the war-ships.
Kataafa, with nearly five thousand
fighting men, can take Ukula and establish
solidly his claim to the kingship.&#8221;</p>

<p>Captain Scott shook hands with Klinger
and the count. &#8220;This check I&#8217;m giving you,&#8221;
Klinger said insinuatingly, &#8220;is subject to recall
if I find you have not played square. You
understand.&#8221;</p>

<p>Scott smiled sadly. &#8220;You see, count, what<span class="pagenum" id="Page_197">[197]</span>
it is to have enemies who constantly defame
one&#8217;s character. Have I ever acted in any
other way but square with you?&#8221; he asked.
The count shook his head.</p>

<p>&#8220;I haven&#8217;t examined the guns nor checked
them over,&#8221; Klinger said by way of explanation.
&#8220;I hope they are as you represent.&#8221;</p>

<p>Scott bowed and walked quickly to the
beach, where his boat and crew were waiting.</p>

<p>The &#8220;fono&#8221; was breaking up. The natives,
by villages, were marching down to the beach;
their weird chants could be heard on all sides.
Great war canoes, paddled by as many as
forty warriors, were swiftly launched, and
sent across the water to the &#8220;Talofa,&#8221; where
they ranged alongside, tier upon tier. Kataafa,
with half a dozen veteran chiefs, dressed in
white shirts and &#8220;lava-lavas,&#8221; their fly-flaps
or fuis held over their right shoulders,
marched slowly down the street. The high
chief stopped at the steps of Klinger&#8217;s house.
He now talked without his talking man, but
in Kapuan, and to Klinger.</p>

<p>&#8220;Kataafa has taken the advice of his white
friends. They tell him now there can be no
war. Kataafa loves his people; he loves his<span class="pagenum" id="Page_198">[198]</span>
enemies.&#8221; As he spoke his left hand played
nervously with a little golden cross on a fine
gold chain slung about his neck. &#8220;If he believed
there would be war he would go away.
But the &#8216;Alii papalangi&#8217;<a id="FNanchor_30" href="#Footnote_30" class="fnanchor">[30]</a> know best, from
their greater wisdom. Kataafa does not understand
papalangi thoughts. He understands
only Kapuan. You tell him to go to
Ukula and make himself king in house of
Laupepe, who is dead. Very well; Kataafa
will go, trusting that all you have said
will be true.&#8221;</p>

<p>Klinger listened, greatly touched. All that
he had told this honorable old warrior Klinger
believed would come true. No other contingency,
he thought, could possibly arise.
Kataafa could march unopposed into Ukula
and make himself king. The English and
Americans could not land their men to oppose
unless the Herzovinian consul also agreed
to this action, and Carlson had given his word
to the count. There might possibly be a few
shots exchanged, and the foreign war-ships
might feel called upon to land guards to protect
foreigners and their property, otherwise<span class="pagenum" id="Page_199">[199]</span>
the war would be only a skirmish. Then
Kataafa, as king, could go to the count or the
consul and ask for the protection of the Herzovinian
flag. That would mean the annexation
desired for so many years and always
prevented by the jealous English.</p>

<p>&#8220;If it comes out differently than I have
told you,&#8221; he replied gravely, &#8220;I shall be
greatly surprised. I have told you exactly
what I believe, and have kept nothing back.&#8221;</p>

<p>Kataafa seemed satisfied. He smiled and
bowed ceremoniously.</p>

<p>Several natives came suddenly down the
road, holding up their hands and shouting
loudly:</p>

<p>&#8220;Papalangi!&#8221;</p>

<p>Klinger ran out into the roadway to get a
clearer view. Several hundred yards up the
crowded thoroughfare, moving slowly through
the native groups, were three American naval
men on horseback. They came straight
toward him; passed him without sign of
recognition, but doffed their caps in answer
to Kataafa&#8217;s greeting and rode out upon the
beach of Saluafata.</p>

<p>Almost at the same instant Captain Scott,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_200">[200]</span>
on board the &#8220;Talofa,&#8221; was much perturbed
at the sight of an English war-ship&#8217;s launch
that had suddenly appeared at the entrance
to the harbor.</p>

<p>One of the riders on the beach produced a
big red flag which he had been carrying and
began calmly waving it, regularly. Then
another flag of similar color was shown in the
launch. The sailor, sitting quietly on his
horse, speedily sent a flag signal. Having
finished, he waited until the flag on the
launch was waved in return. Then the three
horsemen rode leisurely along the beach, apparently
but little interested in the marked
activity before their eyes.</p>

<p>Klinger and the count were dumbfounded.
The high chief&#8217;s countenance was greatly
perplexed.</p>

<p>Klinger knew only too well the significance
of that signal, and the old warrior had made
a shrewd guess at the message conveyed.</p>

<p>A single word from Klinger, and those
three men might never return to Ukula.</p>

<p>Klinger saw at once the great danger in
which the Americans had put themselves.
He called loudly, &#8220;Fanua, Fanua.&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_201">[201]</span>His native wife appeared, smiling and
bowing gracefully. He spoke to her in
English, a language which Kataafa did not
understand. &#8220;Go to those papalangi,&#8221; he
ordered huskily. &#8220;Tell them if they don&#8217;t
ride back, away from Saluafata, at once, I
cannot be responsible for their lives.&#8221; Fanua
obeyed without question. Klinger watched
her reach their side and saw them stop and
turn their horses&#8217; heads&mdash;then, apparently,
calmly consider the message brought them.
Many warriors had gathered; their attitude
seemed to Klinger to be growing every minute
more hostile toward the intruders.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER XII<br />


<small>SMUGGLED ARMS</small></h2>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">As</span> the Americans had ridden their ponies
through the throngs of natives in the street
of the town of Saluafata, the cheery &#8220;Talofa,
Alii&#8221; had been conspicuous by its absence.
Instead Phil&#8217;s interested glance was met upon
all sides by haughty and sullen stares from
the dark-eyed natives.</p>

<p>&#8220;They&#8217;re up to some mischief,&#8221; O&#8217;Neil
whispered, &#8220;and they don&#8217;t like our being
here. That&#8217;s sure.&#8221;</p>

<p>The road or street led now along the sea
beach. The schooner &#8220;Talofa&#8221; lay anchored
a few hundred yards distant. Nearly a dozen
long narrow-flanked war canoes hovered near
or alongside.</p>

<p>&#8220;Guns,&#8221; Sydney exclaimed excitedly.
&#8220;Look, they are being passed down by hand
into those boats alongside.&#8221; One very large
canoe manned by nearly forty naked savages
had just shoved off from the schooner. Its<span class="pagenum" id="Page_203">[203]</span>
crew was singing a stirring song, keeping perfect
time with their paddles as they propelled
the canoe slowly down the beach.</p>

<p>&#8220;They&#8217;ve blackened their faces,&#8221; O&#8217;Neil
declared anxiously. &#8220;You know what that
means?&#8221;</p>

<p>Phil nodded, his heart beating rapidly, and
a thrill passed through him at the thought.
To blacken the face was a declaration of war.</p>

<p>&#8220;Ride straight on,&#8221; Phil commanded, as
they suddenly made a turn, in following the
street which now ran at a sharper angle
toward the beach, and saw before them
Klinger and the count surrounded by natives
in chief dress. &#8220;I can see the British launch.
She&#8217;s just at the reef near the entrance to the
harbor.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;There&#8217;s Kataafa himself,&#8221; O&#8217;Neil exclaimed
excitedly in a low voice. &#8220;The old
man with white hair and moustache.&#8221;</p>

<p>The midshipmen gazed upon him in awe
mixed with admiration. They had not seen
him at such close range before. They saw a
man straight and sturdy, despite his sixty
odd years of age. His countenance was not
fierce as they had expected to find it, but instead<span class="pagenum" id="Page_204">[204]</span>
benevolent and kingly. Every other
face turned toward them showed upon it only
too plainly distrust, anger and resentment,
but the high chief Kataafa alone simply
smiled a welcome and as they drew near said
&#8220;Talofa, Alii, Meliti.&#8221;<a id="FNanchor_31" href="#Footnote_31" class="fnanchor">[31]</a></p>

<p>All three horsemen doffed their caps.</p>

<p>&#8220;Talofa, Alii, Kataafa,&#8221; Phil returned.</p>

<p>&#8220;Call up the boat, O&#8217;Neil,&#8221; Phil said; his
voice was unsteady. &#8220;Say Kataafa has guns,
and warriors have blackened their faces.&#8221;
They were now on the sandy beach close to
the water.</p>

<p>O&#8217;Neil drew from his stirrup leather the
red wigwag flag which he had brought along
for the purpose of sending news quickly back
to Ukula by the steam launch. He began at
once to wave it over his head and scarcely a
second elapsed before a similar flag appeared
in the bow of the tiny launch nearly a mile
away.</p>

<p>&#8220;They were on the job,&#8221; Sydney exclaimed,
while O&#8217;Neil went to work rapidly to send
the signal given him a moment before by
Phil.</p>


<div class="figcenter"><img src="images/i_204.jpg" alt="" /></div>
<p class="caption">HE BEGAN AT ONCE TO WAVE IT</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_205">[205]</span>&#8220;Sent and received, sir,&#8221; he reported as he
flourished the flag in a farewell signal and
then calmly rolled it up, sticking it back into
his boot leather. Then for the first time the
sailor noted the menacing attitude of the
people about them.</p>

<p>A woman&#8217;s voice was calling them from
the edge of the crowd. She was endeavoring
to reach their side.</p>

<p>&#8220;Missi Klinger say you better ride back
quick,&#8221; she cried, her handsome face ashen
with fear for the papalangis. &#8220;Come quick
with me; it might be death to stay longer.&#8221;</p>

<p>Fanua put forth her most eloquent English.
She had been educated at the mission school,
but like most natives was shy in speaking
a foreign language. She had taken Phil&#8217;s
bridle rein, and now led his horse through
the crowd while the other two followed.</p>

<p>&#8220;They won&#8217;t harm us,&#8221; O&#8217;Neil declared
comfortingly, although he did not believe
his own words. &#8220;The signal has roused their
distrust of us, that&#8217;s all.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;We&#8217;re spies,&#8221; Sydney exclaimed. &#8220;Is it
unnatural for them to wish to harm us?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;There&#8217;s no war, sir,&#8221; O&#8217;Neil said, &#8220;so<span class="pagenum" id="Page_206">[206]</span>
we can&#8217;t be spies. And besides, we&#8217;re in uniform.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Then under the laws of war,&#8221; the midshipman
replied, &#8220;they can take us prisoners.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;The news will get through just the same,&#8221;
O&#8217;Neil said gladly, &#8220;and Commander Tazewell
will have warning in time to carry out
whatever plan he has decided upon.&#8221;</p>

<p>Klinger had left his companions and had
advanced to meet the returning Americans.
He walked beside Phil&#8217;s horse, while Sydney
and O&#8217;Neil pushed forward their ponies to
hear. The manager&#8217;s face was the color of
his white clothes.</p>

<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t stop,&#8221; he warned anxiously. &#8220;Even
the king Kataafa could not hold his people if
a fanatic should raise the cry to kill you.&#8221;</p>

<p>Phil did his best to look haughty and unconcerned,
but he could feel his knees tremble
against his pony&#8217;s flanks.</p>

<p>&#8220;You&#8217;ve started your war, I see,&#8221; he mustered
his voice to say, endeavoring to put into
it a note of scorn and defiance.</p>

<p>Klinger did not reply to the accusation.</p>

<p>The Americans were not slow to obey
Klinger&#8217;s directions. Count Rosen scowled<span class="pagenum" id="Page_207">[207]</span>
darkly as they passed him. The chiefs gazed
upon them with angry eyes. Even Kataafa
no longer wore his welcoming smile, but his
eyes were still mild and kindly. To Phil&#8217;s
surprise the high chief fell into step alongside
his pony and trudged silently beside them;
the other chiefs closed in after O&#8217;Neil and
quietly followed. Fanua, the native woman,
darted back to her house, upon the steps of
which the count was left alone.</p>

<p>Upon reaching the top of the hill, Kataafa
and his chiefs stopped while the high chief
waved a dignified salutation. &#8220;Talofa, Alii,&#8221;
he said. Klinger went on a short distance
farther. He had by this time regained his
self-control. The danger had passed.</p>

<p>&#8220;Tell your captain,&#8221; he said earnestly to
Phil, &#8220;that Kataafa has nearly every native
in Kapua on his side. Tell him I say don&#8217;t
let the English throw sand in his eyes. He
has the one chance in his career to do something
for his country. If he throws over the
English and supports us, Tua-Tua and the
island of Kulila might be given to America,
and Kataafa will be king without bloodshed.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I know nothing of my captain&#8217;s plans,&#8221;<span class="pagenum" id="Page_208">[208]</span>
Phil replied distantly, &#8220;but I will deliver your
insulting message. I hope to be able,&#8221; he added
still haughtily, but with a forced smile, &#8220;some
day to repay your civility to us in Saluafata.&#8221;
He saluted stiffly and put his pony to a trot.</p>

<p>The Americans trotted their steeds until
the little animals were breathing heavily from
their exertions. Then Phil allowed his pony
to walk. They were passing through a native
village. Beyond the reef the first of the war
canoes was in sight, and an occasional shout
from an overwrought warrior as he paddled
came distinctly to their ears. A curl of smoke
at the entrance of Vaileli Bay in the general
direction of Ukula marked the progress of the
returning steam launch.</p>

<p>It was nearly two in the afternoon before
Phil and his party reached town. In the
road before the British consulate they saw
drawn up a company of British sailors, while
on the lawn others were setting up their
white tents. The British captain and his
consul hailed them from the porch.</p>

<p>&#8220;We were getting worried about you,&#8221; he
called, waving a greeting. &#8220;You see we&#8217;ve
acted upon the information you secured.&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_209">[209]</span>Phil stopped and told the Englishmen
briefly what they had seen, and then continued
toward the landing.</p>

<p>Alice Lee spied the horsemen and ran out
joyfully to meet them.</p>

<p>&#8220;I began to be frightened,&#8221; she owned.
&#8220;I am deathly afraid of a Kapuan when he
blackens his face.&#8221;</p>

<p>Phil could now smile easily, but he acknowledged
that the sensation of being surrounded
by a swarm of excited warriors, bent
upon war, had not been a pleasant one.</p>

<p>The midshipmen were brought into the
consulate, while O&#8217;Neil continued to the
landing. He had caught sight of the American
sailors marching up the road, and as he
was in the landing detail, he feared some one
might replace him unless he returned to claim
his rights.</p>

<p>Commander Tazewell and the consul were
on the porch, and the consul&#8217;s daughters,
looking slightly pale over the exciting news
brought by the steam launch, which had arrived
an hour earlier, led the newcomers
forward to tell their story.</p>

<p>&#8220;The chief justice gave his decision a very<span class="pagenum" id="Page_210">[210]</span>
short time after you left town,&#8221; Alice told
them breathlessly. &#8220;The news was taken to
Kataafa by a fast canoe. I watched it from
my &#8216;lookout&#8217; until it went inside the reef off
Vaileli.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Kataafa and Klinger must have known
it when we saw them, then,&#8221; Phil said to
Sydney. &#8220;Klinger thought we knew it, too;
that&#8217;s why he gave us the message.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;What was it?&#8221; Alice asked eagerly, overhearing
Phil&#8217;s aside.</p>

<p>&#8220;To cut loose from the English and join
his country in supporting Kataafa,&#8221; Phil told
her. &#8220;He would like to see America disregard
the chief justice&#8217;s decision.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;That looks as if Klinger and his crowd
were worried over the outcome,&#8221; Alice said
thoughtfully, while the midshipmen nodded
their heads in agreement.</p>

<p>Mr. Lee seemed very uneasy while Phil as
spokesman gave a minute account of their
ride to Saluafata. He told of the hostile attitude
of the warriors and Klinger&#8217;s fears for
their safety, and he spoke admiringly of the
old high chief Kataafa, who had acted as their
personal body-guard until the edge of the town<span class="pagenum" id="Page_211">[211]</span>
had been reached. Phil also did not hesitate
to deliver Klinger&#8217;s message which he had
haughtily scorned but agreed to repeat to his
captain.</p>

<p>Commander Tazewell listened gravely, but
to outward appearance was unmoved.</p>

<p>&#8220;Klinger has shown us his game,&#8221; he said
after Phil had ended.</p>

<p>The midshipmen would not accept the invitation
to stay longer. They were hungry and
dusty after their long ride, and pined for a
bath and clean clothes.</p>

<p>As they proceeded toward the boat landing,
they gazed admiringly at their sailors, pitching
tents, erecting shelters and making all arrangement
for a protracted stay on shore.
Lieutenant Morrison stopped them to hear the
news they had brought from the Kataafa camp.
The lieutenant was in command of the American
sailors landed to protect American lives
and property that would be in grave danger
when the rebels attacked Ukula. Ensign Patterson,
a big raw-boned young man, with a
happy, irresponsible disposition, but greatly
loved by all for his generous nature and rash
fearlessness, was Lieutenant Morrison&#8217;s assistant.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_212">[212]</span>
He waved a joyful greeting from a mass
of luggage, the assorting of which he was
busily directing.</p>

<p>&#8220;It certainly looks like business,&#8221; Sydney
exclaimed as they left the busy scene behind
and arrived in sight of the landing, where they
found a boat was awaiting them.</p>

<p>They did not tarry long on the ship, but
were soon again on their way ashore.</p>

<p>As the midshipmen passed again through
the American camp, half-way between the
landing and the American consulate, they espied
O&#8217;Neil&#8217;s soldierly figure mustering the
guard to be posted for the protection of the
west end of the Matautu district of the town.
The English sailors were guarding the eastern
end.</p>

<p>The boatswain&#8217;s mate brought his men to
attention, and gravely saluted the passing
young officers.</p>

<p>Lieutenant Morrison and Ensign Patterson
were inspecting their position. A Colt gun
commanded the main road and another the
road leading inland along the Vaisaigo River.
Temporary barricades were being built back
of the camp, facing the bush, behind which a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_213">[213]</span>
stand could be made if by chance the attack
should come from that direction. This, however,
was unlikely, owing to the dense underbrush
and the boggy soil.</p>

<p>Phil and Sydney greatly envied the officers
with the sailors. They were sure that there
would be fighting soon, and very much feared
that they would find themselves out of it.
However, Commander Tazewell had shown
the midshipmen that he trusted them and was
willing to give them hazardous and important
duty, and they had reason to congratulate
themselves that the duty had been performed
to their captain&#8217;s satisfaction.</p>

<p>&#8220;What about Captain Scott and the &#8216;Talofa&#8217;?&#8221;
Sydney suddenly asked. &#8220;I thought
the captain was bent upon capturing him.&#8221;</p>

<p>Phil shook his head. &#8220;I suppose he figures
there are more important things for us to do
than to chase the &#8216;Talofa.&#8217; He&#8217;s landed his
guns and gotten away by this time. Stump is
still on board the &#8216;Sitka,&#8217; eating his head
off.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Captain Scott certainly played his game
well,&#8221; Sydney declared. &#8220;He&#8217;s a Yankee, all
right. No one else would have been able to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_214">[214]</span>
get so handily out of the mess occasioned by
Stump&#8217;s navigation.&#8221;</p>

<p>At the consulate they found only the consul&#8217;s
daughters.</p>

<p>&#8220;They are having a meeting to decide what
is to be done,&#8221; Alice told them. &#8220;The new
king Panu-Mafili and his chiefs just came to
ask protection. They have scarcely five hundred
warriors, and Avao says many of those
are disloyal, and all their guns are old and
rusty. They bury them, you know, during
peace, so they won&#8217;t be stolen.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Imagine that,&#8221; Phil exclaimed, &#8220;and in
this damp soil. But where&#8217;s the meeting?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;At the house of the chief justice. The
Herzovinian consul sent word he was ill and
couldn&#8217;t attend,&#8221; Alice replied. &#8220;Of course
that means he won&#8217;t agree with anything we
decide to do.&#8221;</p>

<p>The meeting apparently did not last long.
The midshipmen saw the young king, accompanied
by several chiefs, among them the
loyal Tuamana, in company with Mr. Lee
and Commander Tazewell, approaching. At
the consulate gate the natives solemnly bowed
and departed.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_215">[215]</span>&#8220;Kataafa has sent in word,&#8221; Commander
Tazewell told the lads, &#8220;that he will enter
Ukula and re&euml;stablish his government at
Kulinuu. The king, Panu, desires to abdicate
to prevent fighting, and has asked our
advice.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;And we advised him to yield,&#8221; Mr. Lee
added.</p>

<p>&#8220;There&#8217;s nothing else we can do,&#8221; Commander
Tazewell said sorrowfully. &#8220;If we
had sufficient force we could support him,
because he is the rightful king; but two
hundred sailors are not enough to hold the
town, much less be able to seek for and attack
the rebels, numbering many thousands and
all well armed with new and modern
rifles.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Then there will be no fighting after all,&#8221;
Phil exclaimed. And the evident disappointment
in his voice caused a general laugh.</p>

<p>Commander Tazewell shook his head.
&#8220;Some of the chiefs, among them Tuamana,
declared they would not submit, and would
defend Kulinuu, but I believe when they find
themselves outnumbered their ferocity will
subside. We shall guard the Matautu district,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_216">[216]</span>
and I&#8217;ve sent word for all peaceful people to
come here for protection.&#8221;</p>

<p>The midshipmen were further told by their
captain that Mr. Lee had given over a wing
in his big house, and he was sending word to
his steward to bring over a hand-bag of clean
clothes, so the midshipmen scribbled a note
to one of their messmates to send along a
valise full of necessities.</p>

<p>&#8220;It will give my daughters and myself,&#8221;
Mr. Lee said gratefully, &#8220;a feeling of great
security to house you under our roof, and I
hope we can make up in our hospitality for
the lost comforts you enjoy on board ship.&#8221;</p>

<p>Phil and Sydney exchanged amused glances.
Their little two-by-four cabin compared to a
big, airy bedchamber on shore was certainly
funny.</p>

<p>The Herzovinian sailors that had been
landed to guard Klinger&#8217;s store were now
re&euml;nforced and camped near their own consulate
in the Matafeli district of the town.
A flagpole had been erected, and the Herzovinian
flag floated alongside the Kapuan
standard not far away at Kulinuu.</p>

<p>&#8220;One&#8217;s afraid and the other dare not,&#8221; Sydney<span class="pagenum" id="Page_217">[217]</span>
exclaimed as he and Phil lounged luxuriously
in the capacious wicker chairs in their
big bedroom. &#8220;Herzovinia thinks she isn&#8217;t
strong enough to back Kataafa openly and we
know we are not numerous enough to resist
him.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t think the native enters into the
question, really,&#8221; Phil declared. &#8220;You see,
Syd, a fight in which the white people might
be arrayed on both sides would certainly mean
a diplomatic rupture at home. That&#8217;s what
the consuls and naval commanders are trying
to avoid. Herzovinia is deeply involved in
this game. Commander Tazewell hasn&#8217;t said
so, but I believe he thinks that Count Rosen
is really a diplomatic agent sent here to create
an intolerable situation. His government is
tired of this triumvirate control and wants to
own Kapua herself.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I wish the English and Americans had
taken the bull by the horns and sent word to
Kataafa that if he attacked Ukula they would
fire him out by force. I don&#8217;t believe then
he would dare attempt it.&#8221; Sydney&#8217;s eyes
flashed.</p>

<p>&#8220;Those natives we saw to-day,&#8221; Phil replied,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_218">[218]</span>
&#8220;didn&#8217;t look as if they could be so
easily intimidated. I believe the decision
made is the best. We have a big cruiser
coming with an admiral on board. When
she arrives we may have strength enough to
uphold the decision of Judge Lindsay. One
nation has broken the treaty. Consul Carlson,
in refusing to help the other two consuls
to uphold the decision, has shown that he is
partial to Kataafa.&#8221;</p>

<p>At dinner that evening nothing but Kapuan
affairs could be discussed. No one
thought of anything else. The district of
Matautu appeared like an armed camp.
Hundreds of natives had arrived for refuge,
bringing in all their valuables. The balmy
air reeked with cocoanut oil, and the musical
songs of men and women as they squatted
under their hastily constructed shelters were
heard on every side. The terrors of war rested
lightly upon their childlike minds. To
them war was only a festival, an occasion
for song, dancing, kava drinking and visiting.</p>

<p>Before eight o&#8217;clock that evening many
wild rumors were brought into the camp by<span class="pagenum" id="Page_219">[219]</span>
the women. Some of the refugee women had
husbands on one side and some on the other.
Among the Kapuans, women are neutral, and
are free to go freely between the hostile
camps.</p>

<p>Alice and the midshipmen mingled with
the natives in order to gather all the news
brought in. All indications showed that
Kataafa would be as good as his word, and
would attack that night.</p>

<p>The first part of the evening, however,
dragged on and everything seemed quiet in
the direction of the native town and Kulinuu
where a few hundred loyal natives had undertaken
unaided to uphold the rights of their
chosen king against the attack of the rebel
hordes.</p>

<p>Suddenly the startling rattle of musketry
drifted down on the light breeze from the other
side of the bay. Shouts and cries of defiance
and anger could be distinctly heard through
the still night air. Kataafa had broken his
sworn pledge made solemnly and in writing
never again to resist the constituted authority
of Kapua. Three hundred odd sailors of
three great nations listened to the raging of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_220">[220]</span>
the unequal struggle. Among savages, might
is always right. There was no doubt who
would be king of Kapua when the day
dawned, Judge Lindsay and the treaty notwithstanding.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER XIII<br />


<small>UKULA ATTACKED</small></h2>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">The</span> midshipmen hastened to tell Commander
Tazewell the thrilling news of the
attack. They found him, however, on the
porch fully dressed together with the consul
and his daughters.</p>

<p>&#8220;I feel terribly concerned over Judge Lindsay,&#8221;
Mr. Lee exclaimed while all listened
tensely to the fearful sounds of combat coming
so distinctly through the otherwise quiet
night. The refugees huddling in the bush
and among the palm groves were all hushed
to silence, harking to the unequal battle
raging nearly a mile away. &#8220;He refused to
leave his house to come to us. He thought
his belongings were more precious than his
life, and feared if he left his house it would be
looted and destroyed.&#8221;</p>

<p>There was no sleep for those at the American
consulate that night. The heavy firing
was not, however, of long duration. Within<span class="pagenum" id="Page_222">[222]</span>
the hour it died away, except for an occasional
shot. Then fires appeared at many points
along the entire water-front of Ukula. The
rebels were burning the houses of the loyal
natives.</p>

<p>The guarding sailors were alert, and although
war parties appeared and came so
near as to be challenged by the outposts, they
stopped only to parley, and explained that
the papalangi were safe and would not be
attacked. They were seeking only the followers
of Panu-Mafili.</p>

<p>The light of day revealed much of Ukula
in ruins. Stores and houses owned by Americans
and English had all been looted and
the houses of the loyal natives were in ashes.</p>

<p>Half-naked warriors, their hands and faces
smeared with the life blood of their victims,
their eyes rolling wildly in savage ecstasy,
paraded the streets carrying on bamboo poles
the gory heads of their victims.</p>

<p>The Matautu and the Matafeli districts of
the town were undisturbed. In the latter
place lived the Herzovinian merchants and
their consul. The Herzovinian sailors prevented
the war parties from entering the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_223">[223]</span>
Matafeli district. Over five thousand warriors,
unrestrained and unorganized, roamed
the town and surrounding country, pillaging
and firing their guns in savage license.</p>

<p>Many shots had passed very close to those
within the American lines, and as the morning
progressed the desultory firing became
more frequent and dangerous. Several of
the native refugees had been hit by stray
bullets.</p>

<p>While at breakfast news came from the
British ship by signal that many refugees
from the battle-field had swum off to the ships
and been received on board; among them the
king Panu-Mafili and Chief Tuamana.</p>

<p>An hour later Mary Hamilton burst in
upon Mr. Lee excitedly with the startling
intelligence that Judge Lindsay in his big
house on the Malima road was besieged by a
war party under Chief Tuatele, and that the
excited natives were swearing vengeance upon
the judge. Mary had stolen through the
pickets during the night and had listened,
hidden close to the camp of the rebels at the
cross road leading to the judge&#8217;s residence.</p>

<p>&#8220;He must come in now, whether he wishes<span class="pagenum" id="Page_224">[224]</span>
to or not,&#8221; Commander Tazewell declared.
&#8220;I&#8217;m going to send a guard after him.&#8221;</p>

<p>Lieutenant Morrison and twenty-five men
were quickly assembled and departed to rescue
the chief justice. Phil and Sydney were permitted
to go along.</p>

<p>With their arms at the shoulder and
bayonets fixed, the guard marched away, the
officers leading. Reaching the Malima road
they turned inland.</p>

<p>Hundreds of warriors carrying both guns
and head axes made way for them without a
thought of raising a hand to stop them.</p>

<p>When they arrived in sight of the judge&#8217;s
house, nestling among numerous fruit trees,
and half hidden from the road, Lieutenant
Morrison deployed his men into a single line.
Then placing himself and the officers in front
they advanced directly toward the low stone
wall surrounding the grounds of the house.</p>

<p>Phil noted as they approached that many
of the trees had been destroyed, hacked almost
in two with sharp axes, or stripped of
their fruit to appease the appetite of the
hungry warriors.</p>

<p>Suddenly the Americans were confronted<span class="pagenum" id="Page_225">[225]</span>
by over a hundred natives who had no doubt
been apprised of their coming.</p>

<p>Lieutenant Morrison stopped to parley.
Chief Tuatele walked forward, holding himself
proudly erect. Mary Hamilton had gone
along to interpret.</p>

<p>The lieutenant explained his errand and
ordered the rebel chief to withdraw from
American property at once. The intimidation
of the white man&#8217;s unspoken threat was
sufficient. In spite of protest from his followers
Tuatele obeyed, and the band of sailors
entered the compound unopposed.</p>

<p>The chief justice met the lieutenant on his
door-step. His face was pale, but resolute.
He refused to budge, and his plucky wife
applauded his brave decision.</p>

<p>&#8220;I shall never turn my back upon them,&#8221;
he exclaimed. &#8220;A judge is answerable only
to God. I have done my duty by my conscience.&#8221;</p>

<p>Argument was of no avail. Lieutenant
Morrison was in a quandary.</p>

<p>A sudden shout of savage triumph broke
from the rebels outside the compound.
&#8220;Tonga-fiti, tonga-fiti,&#8221; brought the argument<span class="pagenum" id="Page_226">[226]</span>
to an abrupt end. The judge&#8217;s house
was on fire. While the Americans had been
attempting to persuade the judge to leave, a
small party of rebels had stolen into the house
from the rear. That end of the house was
now ablaze.</p>

<p>The judge and his wife were dumbfounded.</p>

<p>&#8220;All that we own in the world is in that
house,&#8221; the judge exclaimed, a dry sob in his
voice. Phil and Sydney turned to the lieutenant
inquiringly. Much could yet be
saved. That officer understood the unspoken
question. He flung a glance at the jeering
savages.</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; he said, &#8220;half of us go in and save
all we can.&#8221;</p>

<p>Within a half hour the beautiful home was
a heap of ruins, but on the lawn was piled
nearly all the judge&#8217;s possessions. His entire
library, his most cherished possession, was
saved.</p>

<p>&#8220;Lieutenant,&#8221; the judge said as he and his
wife gazed mournfully at the ruin of their
home, &#8220;I&#8217;m afraid I must now change my
decision and go with you. It should be rare
for a judge to have to reverse his decision<span class="pagenum" id="Page_227">[227]</span>
except on the occasion of new evidence, and
in this case the evidence is only too evident.&#8221;</p>

<p>The midshipmen, O&#8217;Neil and some of the
sailors had dragged from the stable the judge&#8217;s
carriage; the horses were gone, stolen by the
rebels during the night.</p>

<p>&#8220;We&#8217;ll load it up and come back for a
second load,&#8221; Lieutenant Morrison decided
as he saw the carriage was too small to carry
everything. &#8220;I&#8217;ll remain behind with half
the men.&#8221;</p>

<p>The sailors willingly manned the shafts
and dragged the loaded carriage out of the
compound. The natives gazed lustfully at its
contents. Their blood was boiling for rich
loot, and the silverware of the judge&#8217;s table
whetted their appetites.</p>

<p>Phil observed the sudden movement even
before he heard Mary Hamilton&#8217;s cry of warning,
and a sharp command brought a dozen
bayonets level with the advancing breasts.</p>

<p>&#8220;Tell them, Mary, if they come nearer I
shall fire,&#8221; he cried out earnestly. In his
heart he was terrified, for he knew that unless
the threat were heeded the Americans
must be massacred. Once the Kapuan warriors<span class="pagenum" id="Page_228">[228]</span>
are aroused, they will kill until no enemy
is left to resist them. The fate of the Herzovinian
sailors told him by O&#8217;Neil flashed
into his mind, and the thought was far from
comforting.</p>

<p>Lieutenant Morrison, scarcely a hundred
yards away, realized Phil&#8217;s danger, and
quickly deployed his men to attack the
enemy on the flank. No other solution but
fight occurred to any one. A single gun shot
must have been the signal for the battle to
begin.</p>

<p>Tuatele had seen the pantomime from a
distance, and heard the excited harangue of
the native woman Mary. She had been
soundly berating her countrymen.</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;d think they were gods,&#8221; he exclaimed
in savage admiration as he watched the sailors,
their guns at their shoulder and apparently
calm, &#8220;but I know they die and gods don&#8217;t
die. But Kataafa order no kill papalangi
sailors.&#8221; Then he raised his voice and gave
an order to retreat, and the entire war party,
uttering in unison a savage cry of defiance,
suddenly turned away and quickly disappeared
into the bush.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_229">[229]</span>The judge and his wife were hospitably received
by Mr. Lee and his daughters, and
their belongings when they all arrived were
carefully stored away in the Lee home.</p>

<p>At lunch time a flag of truce appeared,
carried by a small party of natives approaching
from the direction of the town. The guards
went out to meet them and escorted them
within the lines.</p>

<p>A large white envelope was then handed to
Mr. Lee.</p>

<p>The consul eagerly broke the seal and read
the contents; his hands, holding the paper,
shook with suppressed indignation. All
waited anxiously to hear what it was that was
so disturbing.</p>

<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s outrageous,&#8221; he declared as he handed
the letter to Commander Tazewell. &#8220;Kataafa
has made Count Rosen his prime minister,
and asks the consuls to recognize the new
government. The letter&#8217;s in English, but
signed by the rebel chief.&#8221;</p>

<p>Commander Tazewell studied the letter
thoughtfully. &#8220;Well, sir,&#8221; he said grimly,
&#8220;it looks as if it was Hobson&#8217;s choice
with us.&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_230">[230]</span>A footfall on the porch heralded a visitor,
and the British consul was soon seated at the
lunch table.</p>

<p>&#8220;Commander Sturdy has gone off to his
ship to interview the natives who took refuge
with him last night,&#8221; he began hurriedly, his
face unnaturally flushed with excitement.
&#8220;Did you also get one of these impertinencies?&#8221;
he exclaimed showing a crumpled
letter in his hand, a duplicate of the one
Commander Tazewell was still holding.</p>

<p>Mr. Lee nodded. &#8220;Yes,&#8221; he replied, &#8220;and
Commander Tazewell has cleverly showed me
that we are confronted by a fact, not a fancy.
Kataafa holds the power. He is the &#8216;de
facto&#8217; government of Kapua, and if we don&#8217;t
recognize it, anarchy and license will continue
until we do.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I hear Judge Lindsay has been burnt out
and a fight between the rebels and your
sailors was narrowly averted,&#8221; the British
consul exclaimed. &#8220;What are we coming to
in Kapua? And it has all been brought
about by these scheming mercenary merchants.&#8221;</p>

<p>Mr. Carlson&#8217;s portly figure approaching by<span class="pagenum" id="Page_231">[231]</span>
the path from the road dissolved the party at
the lunch table. Miss Lee retired to look
after Judge Lindsay and his wife. The latter&#8217;s
nerves had been greatly shaken during the
trying ordeal through which they had both
passed. Fanatical natives had surrounded
their house during the night, threatening the
judge hourly with death and torture. Only
the iron will of the man in face of imminent
danger, and a resolution that awed the savages,
prevented them from beginning an attack
which once started must have ended in the
death of the chief justice.</p>

<p>The midshipmen and Alice adjourned to
the garden out of ear-shot from the council of
the representatives of the great Powers.</p>

<p>&#8220;There won&#8217;t be any doubt of getting Mr.
Carlson to agree upon recognizing the new
government,&#8221; Alice exclaimed heatedly. &#8220;I
suppose that&#8217;s what he came for.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;He must approve his own work,&#8221; Sydney
replied. &#8220;There&#8217;ll be no chance for an American
or an Englishman, though, under this
government.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s a nice travesty upon the sacredness of
treaties,&#8221; Phil exclaimed in righteous indignation.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_232">[232]</span>
&#8220;The great civilized nations sign a solemn
treaty to direct the government of Kapua.
A chief justice is appointed, confirmed by all
three nations, to decide finally all questions
arising among the natives. The consuls, representing
the three Powers, are by the treaty
bound to uphold the judge&#8217;s decisions, and to
use their war-ships to enforce those decisions.
A decision is rendered. One consul not only
refuses to join in upholding it, but repudiates
it openly.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Is it really as black as that?&#8221; Sydney
asked thoughtfully, appealing to Alice. &#8220;You
know the natives. Whom do they want for
king?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Almost all want Kataafa,&#8221; Alice acknowledged.
&#8220;He is, as I told you, a god in the
natives&#8217; eyes. I can&#8217;t see why he cannot be
king if his people wish it, but Judge Lindsay
has studied the case for a month, and so
decides.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Of course,&#8221; Phil exclaimed, &#8220;the war is
all a put up job. I would, if I were able, indict
for manslaughter every one of those
responsible for this rebellion or who selfishly
refused to avert it lawfully. It made me absolutely<span class="pagenum" id="Page_233">[233]</span>
sick to see those ghastly heads on
poles and know that for every one a life had
been sacrificed to satisfy the selfishness of white
men.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Some one,&#8221; Alice said reverently, &#8220;will
have to account for those deaths before the
great tribunal some day.&#8221;</p>

<p>They saw Mr. Carlson bow formally and
leave the consulate.</p>

<p>&#8220;It didn&#8217;t take long,&#8221; Sydney said as they
watched him go, mopping his perspiring face
as he passed through the gate and turned
toward the town.</p>

<p>&#8220;Do you know,&#8221; Alice said thoughtfully,
&#8220;he is a very kind-hearted soul. I feel very
sorry for him, because he is now shouldering
the bad deeds of others.&#8221;</p>

<p>This short meeting of the consuls brought
a temporary stability to affairs in Kapua. The
three consuls now formally recognized the
&#8220;de facto&#8221; government nominally under
Kataafa. The count was to be the prime minister;
adviser to the king. Judge Lindsay
was to again occupy, if he would, the office of
chief justice. The deposed King Panu-Mafili
and his chiefs, if they would go to Kulinuu,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_234">[234]</span>
and humble themselves before Kataafa, were
to be permitted ashore, otherwise they must
remain in the war-ships.</p>

<p>This all the loyal chiefs refused to do, and
for their safety the war-ships were forced to
keep them on board.</p>

<p>The next day Kataafa was formally crowned
at Kulinuu, but no salute was fired in his
honor. The morning after the coronation the
midshipmen and Alice watched their sailors
gather up their belongings and return on board
their ship.</p>

<p>&#8220;They&#8217;ll be ashore again before very long,&#8221;
Phil prophesied. &#8220;The &#8216;Sacramento,&#8217; one of
our big cruisers, will be on the way here with
an American admiral on board. I have an
idea that he will not be content to see the
islands get away from us without an argument.&#8221;</p>

<p>The town of Ukula was a sorry sight.
Many valuable native houses were in utter
ruin. Many stores owned by the white men
had been looted. Empty cans were scattered
about everywhere. Those canned delicacies
of meats, soups and vegetables, much prized
by the natives, had been consumed or carried<span class="pagenum" id="Page_235">[235]</span>
away. Tin goods in Kapua went by the name
of &#8220;peasoupee,&#8221; because the first cargo of
tinned goods ever received in the islands was
of the pea-soup variety.</p>

<p>Armed natives were encountered on every
hand, but their faces were no longer blackened,
and the savage ecstasy of war had partially
subsided.</p>

<p>Phil stopped a smiling native and asked him
by signs to allow him to inspect his gun.
Alice spoke his own language to him, and the
warrior proudly gave his cherished belonging
into Phil&#8217;s hands.</p>

<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s a brand new &#8216;Snyder,&#8217;&#8221; Sydney said as
they both handled it; &#8220;but look, he has taken
off the sight. Thinks it&#8217;s a useless ornament.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Probably is,&#8221; Phil replied. &#8220;In bush
fighting a sight is probably of little use
unless the native is trained to use it intelligently.&#8221;</p>

<p>The three walked slowly along the main
street. At the gate of the Herzovinian consulate
in Matafeli, they saw Count Rosen.
All were surprised to receive a cordial smile,
as he raised his hat to Alice.</p>

<p>&#8220;Look,&#8221; Phil exclaimed, &#8220;the boxes are<span class="pagenum" id="Page_236">[236]</span>
still on the porch of the Kapuan firm&#8217;s
store.&#8221;</p>

<p>All had stopped to gaze upon the mysterious
boxes yet unopened. A crowd of natives,
laughing and jostling each other, covered the
wide porches encircling the store, and spilled
over into the courtyard.</p>

<p>&#8220;What is the cause of their merriment?&#8221;
Sydney asked. Alice had drawn near a group
of native women who had stopped in front of
the store to gossip together. They turned and
answered her question by pointing to a large
print pasted on the side of the house.</p>

<p>The midshipmen could not curb their curiosity
and drew nearer to get a closer look.</p>

<p>&#8220;I call that a low-down, contemptible advantage
to take of friendly nations,&#8221; Phil
exclaimed, beside himself with indignation.
What he had seen was a colored cartoon from
an English paper representing Herzovinia
kicking both Johnny Bull and Uncle Sam
from off a tropical island into the sea.</p>

<p>The conservative Sydney would have stayed
his impetuous chum, but Phil, before his
friend could realize his intention, had strode
excitedly forward, pushing the yielding natives<span class="pagenum" id="Page_237">[237]</span>
from his path. Sydney saw him take
his penknife and deftly cut the picture from
the house wall where it had been roughly
pasted. Then calmly rolling it up, Phil returned
and joined his astonished companions.</p>

<p>&#8220;What have you done?&#8221; Sydney exclaimed
in alarm. &#8220;They&#8217;ll consider it an insult.&#8221;
But Alice answered the question, admiration
shining in her excited face.</p>

<p>&#8220;He has only prevented an insult going
any further,&#8221; she said.</p>

<p>They were about to retrace their steps to
Matautu when Klinger suddenly appeared
from the interior of the store. He glanced
first in amusement at the Americans, and
then up on the side of the house. The smile
faded. He asked a question of a native and
received an answer. His face became suddenly
pale with rage. His gaze fell upon the
cartoon rolled up in Phil&#8217;s hand. Scowling
darkly he advanced, one hand outstretched.</p>

<p>&#8220;You will please hand over that picture,&#8221;
he ordered sharply.</p>

<p>Phil squared toward the manager, holding
the picture behind him.</p>

<p>&#8220;I decline to give it to you,&#8221; Phil replied<span class="pagenum" id="Page_238">[238]</span>
in a voice he managed to hold steady. &#8220;That
is no place to display such a picture at this
time.&#8221;</p>

<p>Klinger was a man who had all his life
governed with the overseer&#8217;s whip. During
his fifteen years in the South Seas his strong
will had never been seriously thwarted. What
he wanted he took, using force if necessary.
He was a big man, somewhat inclined to
stoutness, but the outdoor life he had lived,
in the saddle for days at a time, riding over
the plantations, had given a hardness to his
added flesh. The person confronting him,
who declined to give back his own property,
was a mere youth. In his white flannels he
sized up of much slighter build if a trifle
taller than the angry manager. Personal violence
was far removed from Phil&#8217;s thoughts.</p>

<p>Klinger, with a snarl of rage, was upon the
midshipman before he could evade the rush.
One of the manager&#8217;s great hands reached
for the lad&#8217;s throat, while his other arm endeavored
to draw in and crush the slight
boy against his massive chest. Sydney and
Alice could only cry out in their surprise and
alarm.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_239">[239]</span>The next moment Klinger appeared to
plunge head first into the roadway beyond,
as if sprung from a catapult. The manager
lay unconscious, a huddled heap of brawn
and muscle, while Phil, very pale and trembling
violently in apprehension, gazed upon
his stricken foe.</p>

<p>&#8220;Jujitsu,&#8221; Sydney exclaimed admiringly,
yet in alarm, as he surveyed the inert form of
Klinger in the roadway.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER XIV<br />


<small>COUNT ROSEN TAKES CHARGE</small></h2>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">The</span> signal victory won by Kataafa and his
warriors and the acknowledgment from the
Powers increased many-fold his trust in the
two papalangi, who had so ably advised
him and supplied the necessary weapons for
success. As the old chief surveyed the work
of destruction, however, his heart sank within
him. The fear of the war-ships and their
thunderbolts, and a vivid recollection of the
last war against the papalangi spurred him
to consult that man of few words, Count
Rosen, whom Klinger had said was vested
with high powers from that great nation beyond
the seas, more powerful than both England
and America.</p>

<p>The English and Americans, he knew,
would soon be crying aloud for retribution.
Their property had been destroyed by his
warriors. The life of the chief justice, an
American, had even been endangered, and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_241">[241]</span>
his valuable house unlawfully burned. To
Kataafa, the papalangi were terrible people.
Those in Kapua he did not fear; he had seen
that they could be killed and beheaded as
easily as men of his own race; but the intangible
nations that protected them, sending
war-ships &#8220;bursting through the clouds,&#8221; as
the Kapuans express the slow approach of a
ship coming up over the sea horizon&mdash;of these
Kataafa stood in mortal fear.</p>

<p>As the blood lust subsided among his warriors,
already gossip bared its disquieting
head. Some said many war-ships of England
and America would come and destroy, as if
by a volcano, their beautiful islands.</p>

<p>Kataafa with his trusted chiefs marched
solemnly to the Herzovinian consulate at
Matafeli. Count Rosen had taken up his
abode in the consulate. He received the
chiefs in silence, and sent word at once for
Klinger to appear to act as interpreter. The
count had that morning been appointed by
the rebel king his prime minister, and the
three consuls had acknowledged, in grudging
terms, the &#8220;de facto&#8221; government, as they
pointedly expressed it.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_242">[242]</span>Klinger did not appear and finally the
native messenger returned with the information
that Missi Klinger was very sick. The
count excused himself to the chiefs, telling
them to wait, and hurried away to see what
was the matter. There on a low couch in the
store office he found the manager, but just
regaining consciousness. A white doctor was
attending him, examining his entire body
carefully for serious injuries. The story of
the encounter with the Americans was told
most graphically to the count by a number
of native eye-witnesses, and each described
the strength of the &#8220;young David&#8221; as greater
than that of &#8220;Sampson&#8221; himself. The Kapuans
are well up on the Bible and glory in
airing their knowledge.</p>

<p>Klinger, when he came to himself, made a
great effort to rise, thinking his antagonist
was still before him, but the doctor&#8217;s strong
hands, applying wet bandages to a very
ugly contusion over his temple, upon which
he had struck in his fall, held him quiet.
The count had taken a seat at his side. He
wore a displeased frown as he listened to the
babble about him.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_243">[243]</span>&#8220;Clear them out, please,&#8221; he exclaimed
irritably. The women were sent away, all
but Klinger&#8217;s wife, Fanua, who waited patiently
to be told what to do.</p>

<p>Klinger at length sat up and gazed about
him. He raised a hand to his aching head
and felt the great bulk of wet dressing plastered
by the doctor over his cut. Then he
read the displeasure evident in the count&#8217;s
face.</p>

<p>&#8220;They did me,&#8221; he exclaimed. &#8220;One of
them hit me with a black-jack.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You&#8217;ve made yourself the laughing stock
of the town,&#8221; the count declared angrily.
&#8220;I&#8217;ve heard the story. It was simply science
against unwieldy beef.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll show the young aristocrat,&#8221; the manager
began to bluster, but the count cut him
short impatiently.</p>

<p>&#8220;You&#8217;ll just drop this thing where it is,&#8221;
he commanded authoritatively. &#8220;It was a
childish piece of folly to put up that cartoon,
and the youngster has my admiration. You
should thank your stars you haven&#8217;t a broken
neck instead of only a small cut in your hard
head. He used jujitsu on you.&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_244">[244]</span>Such words did not sound sweet to Klinger&#8217;s
ears. He was unaccustomed to being taken
to task thus wise, and the sullen expression
on his face showed plainly his displeasure.</p>

<p>&#8220;Get yourself in shape,&#8221; the count added,
his voice less severe in tone. &#8220;Kataafa and
his chiefs have come to the consulate, and I
won&#8217;t trust any of these professional native
interpreters.&#8221;</p>

<p>Klinger rose slowly to obey the summons.
The count waited impatiently on the porch
of the store. He was not slow in seeing that
the encounter had hurt their cause. Anything
that can be held up to ridicule by so
much is seriously injured. For policy&#8217;s sake
he would have liked to severely punish this
young, athletic American. To do so would
help the prestige of the new government in
the natives&#8217; eyes, but he feared that such high-handed
measures might injure the cause for
which he was working by opposition from the
Powers.</p>

<p>When the count and Klinger reached the
consulate the rebel chiefs laid before them
the plan which they had been discussing
among themselves. On request of the count,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_245">[245]</span>
Kataafa so far transgressed the ancient
Kapuan custom as to talk without the delay
of speaking through the &#8220;talking man,&#8221;
while Klinger readily translated his well
chosen and eloquent words.</p>

<p>He desired the count to be at the head of
the government as governor. To take the
place of chief justice of Kapua&mdash;to hoist the
Herzovinian flag by the side of the Kapuan
flag and by so doing receive the support of
their war-ship. Further, he had written a
&#8220;cry&#8221;<a id="FNanchor_32" href="#Footnote_32" class="fnanchor">[32]</a> which he desired be sent to the king
of the count&#8217;s country, asking annexation.
He said the Kapuans were but children, and
Kapua was but a bone between three hungry
dogs. He feared the coming of more war-ships,
and would willingly leave everything
in the count&#8217;s wise hands.</p>

<p>Count Rosen was deeply thoughtful. The
wanton pillage of the Kataafa warriors and
their barbarous killing and beheading of the
native supporters of the chief justice&#8217;s choice
for king had greatly shocked him. He had
failed to appreciate the natural cruelty of
even the gentlest savages when their primitive<span class="pagenum" id="Page_246">[246]</span>
passion for bloodshed is aroused. Now
to accept this petition and hoist the flag could
not be considered. If there had been no
bloodshed, then his countrymen at home
might have upheld him if he hoisted the
flag and even formally annexed the islands.
But he could offer as his excuse in accepting
the office of governor the desire to bring
about peace and allow the commerce of the
islands to continue unchecked and in accordance
with civilized law. But first he must
feel his ground slowly. The other two
Powers looked on with jealous eyes.</p>

<p>&#8220;I cannot be chief justice,&#8221; he said after
a long pause, &#8220;until Judge Lindsay has resigned
that office. Send and ask him to
continue in that position, and if he refuses,
Kataafa has the right to appoint another.&#8221;</p>

<p>A letter was quickly written and dispatched.
Within a half hour a verbal
answer was returned to the effect that Judge
Lindsay did not recognize any king of Kapua
save Panu, and that he, Lindsay, was yet the
chief justice.</p>

<p>The count smiled sardonically.</p>

<p>&#8220;I shall accept the position of governor<span class="pagenum" id="Page_247">[247]</span>
and perform also the duties of chief justice,&#8221;
he said, &#8220;under the de facto government, but
annexation we shall discuss later. First we
must begin to repair all damage done, especially
to the foreigners.&#8221;</p>

<p>Kataafa and his chiefs withdrew. They
smiled triumphantly. They believed all
trouble had been lifted from their shoulders.
This man, the count, had relieved them of all
disagreeable consequences of their acts of
violence. The men-of-war were undoubtedly
afraid of him. So argued the chiefs
of the rebel leader. Upon the announcement
that the count was to be the adviser of Kataafa,
the papalangi had carried their sailors back
to their ships. Now, since the count was
equal to the king or governor, maybe the
war-ships would sail away &#8220;under the sea&#8221;
and not return. The other war-ships that
people said were coming would be afraid to
let loose their thunder when they learned
that this count and representative of a powerful
papalangi king was at the head of the new
government. With these quieting thoughts
the stately chiefs filed out of the consulate and
turned toward the king&#8217;s residence at Kulinuu.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_248">[248]</span>Count Rosen was not afraid of the consequences
of his act. He gloried in the
thought that his country was nearer a settlement
of the Kapuan difficulty than she had
ever been. Yet there were points in the
proceedings which gave him considerable
concern. The principal one was his knowledge
that the American commander had discovered
the source of the Kataafa guns and
doubtless also suspected that the rebellion of
the old warrior had been planned in order to
create just the situation by which the Americans
and English now found themselves confronted.
If he only dared raise his country&#8217;s
standard over the islands! The count reasoned
that Kapua would be taken by the
country whom the natives chose to govern
them. Now he had the opportunity of showing
them what good government really meant,
and if he could succeed in winning the native
confidence, his country would be the choice
of the people. In the last war the natives,
when maltreated and coerced by the Kapuan
firm and the Herzovinian war-ships, appealed
to England for annexation. England would
have liked to grant the request, but her rival&#8217;s<span class="pagenum" id="Page_249">[249]</span>
friendship at that time was needed more than
were the Kapuan Islands; so no notice was
paid by the British Cabinet to the pitiful cry
from the far-away South Sea monarchy.</p>

<p>&#8220;Klinger,&#8221; the count said seriously, &#8220;you
must take charge of the native laborers. Repair
all damage possible to foreign property
and guarantee to all just compensation. I
shall grant full amnesty to all the supporters
of Panu-Mafili. Be careful,&#8221; he added severely.
&#8220;Don&#8217;t antagonize the foreigners.
Don&#8217;t grab too much, or we may lose all.&#8221;</p>

<p>Within a week Ukula and the surrounding
country was as peaceful as before the death of
the old king Laupepe. New houses were going
up on every hand, a sure sign of future
peace in Kapua. By order of the count, who
had taken charge of the government of the
islands in fact as well as in fancy, guns could
not be carried by the natives. The natives
were encouraged to indulge in their Siva-Siva
dances, at which the count made it his business
to be present.</p>

<p>The English and American consuls maintained
a haughty reserve when they transacted
business with the governor, as the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_250">[250]</span>
natives called the count, but a semi-friendly
relation was soon established between him and
the naval officers.</p>

<p>The count provided himself a new house,
built within a month, on the bungalow style,
but of native workmanship, and invited all
to a dance given in celebration of the opening.</p>

<p>The lawn in front of the house was on this
occasion reserved for the Siva-Siva dancers.</p>

<p>The count received his guests in the lanai.
The stately figure of Kataafa stood by his side
and all visitors shook hands with him most
cheerfully as they entered to greet the host.</p>

<p>Phil and Sydney accompanied Commander
Tazewell. Alice and her sister came also, but
Mr. Lee sent his regrets on account of indisposition.
The mail had not arrived from
home, and both the British consul and
Mr. Lee considered it wiser in their official
positions to refrain from an act which might
savor of a recognition of the justice of the
government. Judge Lindsay returned his
invitation unopened.</p>

<p>The house was decorated profusely with
bright bush flowers, and their perfume mingling
with the odor of cocoanut oil with which<span class="pagenum" id="Page_251">[251]</span>
all Kapuans plentifully adorn their skins,
gave the occasion a distinction which remained
long in Phil&#8217;s memory.</p>

<p>Herzovinian and Kapuan flags entwined
were everywhere in evidence.</p>

<p>Everybody of any consequence, whatever
their nationality, was there and the count
moved at ease among them. He was, however,
particularly attentive to the American
commander.</p>

<p>The best Siva-Siva dancers had been collected,
and as the house was entirely too small
for the European dances, the guests were
soon gathered on the lawn, where many chairs
and benches had been placed. Two great bonfires
had been built to furnish light in order
to see the graceful movements of the dancers.</p>

<p>The count had escorted Commander Tazewell
to the lawn. Phil and his friends fell
in behind and found themselves in the front
row where an excellent view was to be had
when the dancers appeared.</p>

<p>&#8220;Those old women are the orchestra,&#8221;
Alice told them, pointing to a dozen or more
figures huddled up on mats beyond the illumination
of the bonfires.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_252">[252]</span>Even as she spoke the count had raised his
hand as a signal to begin.</p>

<p>Immediately the dim figures began to beat
time with sticks upon their mats; while from
the darkness a volume of savage melody burst
forth. Then came slowly forward from the
shadow into the illumination a score of men
in single file, their arms on each other&#8217;s
shoulders. To Phil it resembled the prison-gang
step, but every move of their half-naked
bodies was graceful. The light reflected
from their shiny skins gave a startling
effect. On each head was a green wreath.
Gummed to cheeks, ears and nose were hanging
pendants of the leaves of the crimson
hibiscus flower. About their necks were
worn circles of boar tusks mixed with scarlet
peppers and bright berries.</p>

<p>They entered, first slowly, singing a low
and slow measure which increased as their
movements quickened, until with a final rush
they threw themselves into a squatting position
on the ground facing the numerous audience.</p>

<p>Great was the applause when an equal
number of women suddenly made their appearance<span class="pagenum" id="Page_253">[253]</span>
from the opposite direction. Phil
watched them fascinated. On they came with
pride and consciousness of exalted position
and importance. They were redolent and
glistening with perfumed oil. Garlands of
bright leaves and vivid flowers, wonderfully
made, crowned their flowing locks. Like the
men, necklaces from their beloved bush
adorned their graceful necks. About their
slender waists and hanging to the knee were
fabulously valuable soft mats, their only garments.
Garlands of green leaves encircled
their knees and ankles. All this Phil knew
vaguely before. His eager eyes clung to the
leading dancer&#8217;s face and did not leave it to
define the marvelous costumes of those
following. The girl was Avao, and leading
the Siva-Siva given by Count Rosen and
Kataafa. So surprised was he that he turned
suddenly toward Alice, a question bursting on
his lips.</p>

<p>&#8220;Wait,&#8221; she breathed.</p>

<p>Avao, the Tapau of Ukula, daughter of
Tuamana, the irreconcilable loyalist, was
dancing before his enemies, while he was
still a self-imposed exile on board the American<span class="pagenum" id="Page_254">[254]</span>
war-ship. What did it mean? Could it
be that even Tuamana had been won by this
remarkable foreign nobleman?</p>

<p>At length the dancers were in place, in
two rows, the women in front, and all seated
cross-legged. The Tapau with her marvelous
head-dress of human hair and mother of
pearl, glistening in the firelight, sat smiling
proudly in the middle of her troupe. The
orchestra, now reinforced by many good
voices, was keeping time. The dancers were
motionless as if struck from gleaming marble
and then Avao raised her arms, flinging them
out with graceful ease, and as if the twoscore
men and women had been molded into a
single figure, every arm was flung out in perfect
unison with their girlish leader. It was
a drill of the most difficult kind, requiring
years of daily practice. No single person
seemed to lag or get out of time, while all
the while a weird chant rose and fell and
finally as the movements, at first slow and
deliberate, took on a galloping pace, the high
treble of the women and the harsh bass of the
men mounted to a pitch of delirious and
savage ecstasy and then suddenly stopped.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_255">[255]</span>
A thunder of applause greeted the marvelous
performance. Phil for the first time withdrew
his eyes from the savage beauty of the
scene and saw that hundreds of sailors of all
three nations had been admitted to the show.
He recognized the uniform of the American
sailors and smiled with pleasure at their warm
reception to the efforts of Avao, to whom was
due the credit for the perfect dancing of the
youth and maids of Ukula.</p>

<p>Figure after figure was performed. The
enthusiasm of the natives rose higher as the
evening wore on.</p>

<p>Suddenly the band began to play the Kapuan
national air, and all rose to their feet.
After it had finished all eyes were again
turned to the dancers.</p>

<p>Slowly, gracefully they swayed their supple
bodies and arms. The orchestra was silent
except for the staccato time made by the
sticks striking the dry mats. The dancing
and singing seemed to be done subconsciously.
No effort seemed to be used, yet
all followed in movement, in tune and in
word, the leading Tapau, each performer linking
his own consciousness with the mind of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_256">[256]</span>
the maiden as if swayed by her will. What
she did and said was done and said without
appreciable interval by each of the dancers.
Such was the marvelous degree of the training.</p>

<p>&#8220;This is the last,&#8221; Phil heard the count
say. &#8220;It is a song in honor of the king.&#8221;</p>

<p>Alice heard and smiled. Phil saw her lips
tremble and her color pale in the firelight.</p>

<p>&#8220;Panu-Mafili o le Tupu-e-Kapua&mdash;ah!&#8221;</p>

<p>A solemn hush came over the assemblage.
The song gained volume, faster and faster.
Then a roar shook the air and the great concourse
of native spectators had risen to their
feet.</p>

<p>The performers appeared not to appreciate
the meaning of the crowd. Phil had risen
suddenly from his chair&mdash;ready, but for what
he did not know. The song had conveyed
nothing to his mind. He had not understood
the words, so swiftly were they sung. A
glance at the count told that he, too, was in
the dark. Phil was conscious of Alice&#8217;s trembling
hand on his arm and heard her whisper,
&#8220;They are praising Panu-Mafili as king instead
of Kataafa. Avao is getting her revenge<span class="pagenum" id="Page_257">[257]</span>
for being asked to lead. You know a Tapau
cannot refuse to dance if asked by a chief.&#8221;</p>

<p>With a final graceful sway the dancers
jumped to their feet, their hands held aloft
in sign of finality. The audience had now
completely drowned the voices of the singers.
Phil saw several chiefs rush toward the
dancers. The crowd was in an uproar. The
dancers gave way before the threat of those
who had advanced, menacing them with
bodily injury. Avao stood almost alone, a
smile of defiance upon her handsome face.</p>

<p>&#8220;Is she in danger?&#8221; Phil asked excitedly
of Alice at his side. &#8220;Would they dare injure
her?&#8221; Before Alice could answer Phil perceived
the distorted countenance of Klinger.
He had risen from his seat at some distance
from the count. Phil saw him talking and
gesticulating with a group of natives, pushing
them forward, as if directing them to commit
some act which they were reluctant to do.</p>

<p>Avao, with unconcern in her face, appeared
not to hear the torrent of abuse heaped upon
her from all sides. Several women darted
toward her and endeavored to tear her costume
to pieces. She evaded these angry<span class="pagenum" id="Page_258">[258]</span>
rushes, but Phil saw that the temper of the
crowd would not be appeased until revenge
upon this daring girl had been taken.</p>

<p>&#8220;Look,&#8221; Alice cried out joyfully; &#8220;the
sailors are coming to her rescue.&#8221; Phil saw
a mass of white suddenly encircle the cringing
dancers and then face outward toward the
crowd. He recognized O&#8217;Neil as their leader,
and wondered what would happen next.</p>

<p>Klinger was talking excitedly to the count.
The latter had ceased to smile. A dark frown
was in his face. Then Phil noticed him raise
his hand to quell the disturbance. A loud
voice of a chief at his side warned all to
silence. Slowly the babel died away.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER XV<br />


<small>THE &#8220;DE FACTO&#8221; GOVERNMENT</small></h2>
</div>

<p>&#8220;<span class="smcap">Bring</span> the girl to me,&#8221; the count commanded.</p>

<p>The angry natives made way for the proud
Tapau as she advanced toward the governor.
Phil read in their savage glances that
this brave girl, if she were left to their mercy,
was in great danger.</p>

<p>In front of the count and Commander Tazewell,
Avao stopped. Her eyes were cast down,
but she held her head high; then making
a low bow she bent her knee in sign of
submission.</p>

<p>&#8220;Will you not sing for King Kataafa?&#8221;
the count asked kindly. Phil listened eagerly
for her answer. The tumult about them was
hushed.</p>

<p>&#8220;Alii,&#8221; Avao answered, &#8220;I have sung for
the king of Kapua. Panu-Mafili has been declared
our king by the chief justice.&#8221;</p>

<p>Count Rosen&#8217;s face paled, and he bit his<span class="pagenum" id="Page_260">[260]</span>
lips to suppress his great annoyance and
mortification. Klinger&#8217;s rough voice behind
him was distinctly audible.</p>

<p>&#8220;Throw her out. We can get another
Tapau leader.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Will you not sing Kataafa&#8217;s praise?&#8221; the
count asked, not heeding Klinger&#8217;s interruption.</p>

<p>Avao gave her answer readily and distinctly.</p>

<p>&#8220;I will lead the song for Kataafa as a great
chief, loved and honored by his people.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t bother with the cantankerous girl,&#8221;
Klinger recommended brutally.</p>

<p>Commander Tazewell recognized the awkwardness
of the situation. His admiration
was for the girl who had drawn down upon
her head the anger of most of her own race.
Her loyalty to her father, Tuamana, and the
rightful king could not be shaken. He
turned to the count, a smile on his face.</p>

<p>&#8220;We are all greatly indebted,&#8221; he said,
&#8220;for this delightful evening. I thank you
for myself, officers and men.&#8221; Then after
wringing the count&#8217;s hand, he turned gallantly
to the silent Tapau.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_261">[261]</span>&#8220;Will you take my arm?&#8221; he said.</p>

<p>To the surprise of everybody and the
chagrin of the governor and Klinger, Avao
passed her arm through the American commander&#8217;s
and together they marched determinedly
toward the gate. Phil, Sydney, and
Alice fell in behind, while the sailors, seeing
that the other dancers were not to be menaced
by the crowd, the entire blame being placed
on the shoulders of their leader, the Tapau,
quietly dispersed, and withdrew from the
grounds.</p>

<p>Having gained the road, Commander Tazewell
relinquished his charge into Alice&#8217;s
keeping.</p>

<p>&#8220;You must come home with me,&#8221; the
young girl declared. &#8220;Oh, Avao! I could
hug you, if it weren&#8217;t for all that smelly oil
you have rubbed on yourself.&#8221;</p>

<p>The midshipmen joined in praise of the
heroine.</p>

<p>&#8220;Avao,&#8221; Commander Tazewell said as he
was about to leave the party at the dock to
return to the ship, &#8220;your courage to-night
was of a higher order than mere men display.
You have taught your own people and even<span class="pagenum" id="Page_262">[262]</span>
others a lesson in loyalty and honor. They
did not see it then, but some of them will
after they have had time to think over your
simple words.</p>

<p>&#8220;What you said to the count,&#8221; he added as
he shook her hand, &#8220;was told to Kataafa by
a chief at my side in his native tongue. The
great chief&#8217;s face showed no anger. I thought
I read admiration and maybe a consciousness
of guilt. Kataafa, I fear, has been badly advised
by his trusted white friends.&#8221;</p>

<p>Avao was too greatly touched to express
her gratitude in English. A flood of her own
poetic tongue, only partly understood by the
American captain, was her answer.</p>

<p>The midshipmen left the two young girls
at the consulate and returned toward the
landing.</p>

<p>&#8220;It was the count&#8217;s own fault,&#8221; Phil declared.
&#8220;He sent word to Avao that she
must lead, and by the Kapuan custom, a
Tapau cannot refuse.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Well,&#8221; Sydney replied, &#8220;as O&#8217;Neil would
say, &#8216;he got his!&#8217;&#8221;</p>

<p>The easy-going life of the natives in Kapua
now seemed to have again returned. Under<span class="pagenum" id="Page_263">[263]</span>
the new government many improvements were
made. The streets of Ukula were cleaned,
and a campaign was made by the new government
upon the native neglect in leaving their
fruit to decay in the open, thus increasing the
great pest of flies. The trade of the Kapuan
firm flourished. The foreign traders, English
and American, complained to their consuls
bitterly. No one would buy from them.
When they asked their farmer customers the
reason, they received the smiling answer,
&#8220;We shall soon belong to Herzovinia, so we
wish to see how we like to buy our supplies
from them.&#8221;</p>

<p>Several weeks thus went by without important
disagreements between the &#8220;de facto&#8221;
government and the foreign consuls. Kataafa
remained quietly in Kulinuu. His army was
not, however, disbanded. Their guns for the
time being were hidden from view, but the
warriors who had assembled from all parts of
the islands in answer to the call of their choice
for king did not return to their homes. All
the natives who had been loyal to Panu, except
the rightful king and his high chief
Tuamana, were again living their usual<span class="pagenum" id="Page_264">[264]</span>
lives ashore. The latter two refused to acknowledge
Kataafa, and remained on board
the &#8220;Sitka.&#8221; The two rival factions lived side
by side, apparently without discord. The
women engaged in many heated altercations,
and frequently spread disquieting alarms of
impending strife between the two political
parties, but nothing ever came of these prophecies
except now and then a personal encounter
between natives of diverging views,
which was settled without recourse to anything
more hurtful than fists and clubs.</p>

<p>One day the whole town of Ukula was ringing
with the news of a murder. A black boy,
a Solomon Islander, on the Kapuan firm&#8217;s
plantation at Vaileli had been deliberately
shot and killed by a Kataafa warrior. The
latter after committing the crime strolled
proudly into the town, boasting that he had
shot a &#8220;black pig.&#8221;</p>

<p>Phil and Sydney were in the consulate when
Avao brought this sensational news.</p>

<p>Killing during a war was looked upon by
the foreigners as in the order of things, but
during peace times such crimes could not be
tolerated.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_265">[265]</span>&#8220;Give a child a gun,&#8221; Phil exclaimed, &#8220;and
there&#8217;s no telling what will happen.&#8221;</p>

<p>Alice drew all the gruesome particulars from
her native girl friend, and retailed them to the
midshipmen.</p>

<p>&#8220;He did it just to see how his gun would
shoot,&#8221; she told them. &#8220;And when he found
the bullet wouldn&#8217;t kill the black boy at the
first shot he walked up close and shot him
twice more, then severed his head from his
body and brought it to town to show the wonderful
power of the rifle.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;What will they do about it?&#8221; Sydney
asked.</p>

<p>Alice shook her head.</p>

<p>&#8220;The murdered black belongs to the Kapuan
firm,&#8221; she replied. &#8220;He was worth about
a thousand dollars. Under the Kapuan law
there is no penalty for murder, but under the
laws of the treaty the penalty is death.&#8221;</p>

<p>Every one was greatly surprised when they
heard that the murderer had been arrested by
Johnny Upolu, on a warrant issued by the
count himself, and he would be tried by the
native court of Ukula.</p>

<p>The midshipmen and Alice did not miss the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_266">[266]</span>
trial. It was simple, and after the episode was
told, the accused refused to make any defense.</p>

<p>For three days the judges deliberated over
their verdict.</p>

<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s a wonder to me,&#8221; Mr. Lee said, on his
porch after the trial was over and before the
verdict had been given, &#8220;that there haven&#8217;t
been more of these terrible affairs. Nearly
five thousand natives now have guns hidden
in their homes and there&#8217;s no telling when the
lust to kill will come to some of them. As I
watched this murderer&#8217;s face during his trial, I
could see no signs of penitence. He seemed to
be proud of his exploit. If they would hang
this fiery young warrior publicly it would
make me think more kindly of the count and
his government.&#8221;</p>

<p>The midshipmen readily agreed to the sentiment.</p>

<p>&#8220;But,&#8221; Phil objected, &#8220;the count is trying
to gain popularity with all the natives, and if
they hang this man for only killing a black
slave, the natives will consider they have been
treated unjustly. I doubt whether the man
will be punished.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;If he is not,&#8221; Mr. Lee exclaimed, &#8220;it will<span class="pagenum" id="Page_267">[267]</span>
be a blot upon our civilization, and I, as American
consul, will strongly condemn the morals
of this unrighteous government that permits
a murderer to move among us unpunished; in
fact, worshiped by the others as a hero.&#8221;</p>

<p>Mary Hamilton paid the consul and his
family a long visit. Her husband was one of
the five judges who were still considering
what to do and she was eager to learn what
the American &#8220;Alii&#8221; thought, in order that
she could go back and give good advice to her
lord and master.</p>

<p>&#8220;It is very difficult,&#8221; she said in remarkably
good English; &#8220;if they find the man
guilty and order his death all our people
will cry out upon the judges for hanging a
brave warrior who has done nothing wrong
fa&#8217;a Kapua. To kill a &#8216;black&#8217; man is all
the same as shooting a pig. And,&#8221; she
added, &#8220;if they say what they would like to
say and set the man free, the count and Missi
Klinger will be very angry, and after we belong
to their country will punish the judges
severely.&#8221;</p>

<p>Mr. Lee laughed, despite the seriousness in
Mary&#8217;s voice.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_268">[268]</span>&#8220;It&#8217;s their duty, Mary,&#8221; he replied, &#8220;to
find according to the facts. If this man
killed another deliberately and without provocation
they should condemn him to be
hung. If the man were a white man and I
were the judge that is what I should be bound
to do.&#8221;</p>

<p>Mary looked puzzled.</p>

<p>&#8220;But, Alii,&#8221; she replied, &#8220;this man is a
very good man. He is a fine fighter, and a
leader among the men of his family. This
black boy was no good. Is it right that a
good man be killed just because a bad black
boy is killed?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;A life for a life, Mary,&#8221; Mr. Lee replied
firmly. &#8220;That is the white man&#8217;s law.&#8221;</p>

<p>The next day the judges gave their decision.
It was that the native was guilty of murder
and must be hung.</p>

<p>The midshipmen were passing the jail a
few days after the sentence had been given.
They saw the prisoner squatting quietly
within the doorway of the prison, talking
unconcernedly with his policeman guard.</p>

<p>&#8220;I feel sorry for that poor chap,&#8221; Sydney
said sadly. &#8220;He&#8217;s a victim of white interference.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_269">[269]</span>
Why should we force our laws upon
these savages? According to his method of
thinking, he has done no more than step on
a cockroach, and he can&#8217;t see why we make
so much fuss about it. Anyway, he doesn&#8217;t
seem to be worrying&mdash;nature has omitted
nerves in his make-up.&#8221;</p>

<p>Phil had drawn near and now spoke a few
words to the condemned man, who smiled
affably and pointed gleefully into the next
room, where several natives were going
through some mysterious looking pantomime.</p>

<p>&#8220;Go ahead; don&#8217;t mind us, Johnny,&#8221; Phil
exclaimed as the chief of police and his assistants
stopped their performance and glanced
sheepishly at the midshipmen.</p>

<p>&#8220;By George!&#8221; Sydney exclaimed in horror.
&#8220;A rehearsal before the principal.&#8221;</p>

<p>One policeman was carefully greasing a
wicked looking rope with a knot and noose
at one end. Three others were practicing
pinioning and &#8220;turning off&#8221;<a id="FNanchor_33" href="#Footnote_33" class="fnanchor">[33]</a> the culprit.
One, to make the scene realistic to their admiring
audience, was chained and placed in
the corner of the room. The other two then<span class="pagenum" id="Page_270">[270]</span>
would approach with straps in their hands,
knock off the shackles from the supposed condemned
man and quickly pinion him. Then
the three would march slowly to the middle of
the room. They adjusted an imaginary noose,
drew on a real black cap over the make-believe
prisoner&#8217;s head, adjusted the straps and then
at a sharp word of command, all but the
make-believe condemned man stepped smartly
aside, and then one went through the motion
of springing the trap upon which the blindfolded
policeman was supposed to stand.
Johnny Upolu told the midshipmen proudly
that they had practiced it over a hundred
times already, and hoped that it would be a
sight worth seeing, and advised them not on
any account to miss the real hanging.</p>

<p>The prisoner understood sufficient English
to understand and smiled, adding his wish
that they should not miss the show.</p>

<p>&#8220;How&#8217;s that for nerve?&#8221; Phil exclaimed.
&#8220;Sitting there watching himself hung and
actually smiling over it. I&#8217;m certainly not
going to miss the real thing. I wonder if his
splendid nerve will break down at the last?&#8221;</p>

<p>The day of execution was set at a week<span class="pagenum" id="Page_271">[271]</span>
hence. The &#8220;de facto&#8221; government, as the
British and American consuls insisted upon
calling it, apparently had decided that in the
interest of civilization the dread sentence of
the law should be carried out with due decorousness.</p>

<p>Stump, who was by trade a carpenter and
who had in some unaccountable way been experienced
in erecting gallows, was seen directing
the erection of a novel sort of framework
on the public &#8220;Malae&#8221;<a id="FNanchor_34" href="#Footnote_34" class="fnanchor">[34]</a> at Kulinuu.</p>

<p>&#8220;Who gave you the job?&#8221; O&#8217;Neil asked
Stump, after he and Marley had watched the
work for several minutes.</p>

<p>Stump did not answer; instead he drew
near the boatswain&#8217;s mate and whispered
anxiously:</p>

<p>&#8220;&#8216;Bully&#8217; Scott hasn&#8217;t left the islands yet.
He and the &#8216;Talofa&#8217; are around at Saluafata
harbor, the other end of the island. He sent
me word by a native to come back, or he&#8217;d
come and get me.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You don&#8217;t believe he will, do you?&#8221;
O&#8217;Neil asked.</p>

<p>&#8220;There ain&#8217;t many things he won&#8217;t do<span class="pagenum" id="Page_272">[272]</span>
when he sets his mind to it,&#8221; Stump replied
nervously. &#8220;Klinger offered me this job,&#8221;
he added. &#8220;I&#8217;ve done some smart carpentering
in my time. I&#8217;ve got to earn enough
money to pay my way back to &#8216;Frisco.&#8217;&#8221;</p>

<p>O&#8217;Neil&#8217;s sympathy was aroused at once.</p>

<p>&#8220;You&#8217;re an American,&#8221; he said. &#8220;Why
don&#8217;t you ship in the navy? We need a carpenter.&#8221;</p>

<p>Stump shook his head.</p>

<p>&#8220;No more going to sea for Ben Stump.
I&#8217;m going home and look up my folks.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;When&#8217;s this show coming off?&#8221; O&#8217;Neil
asked, changing the subject; he saw Stump
wasn&#8217;t keen to go in the navy again.</p>

<p>&#8220;Between you and me, Mr. O&#8217;Neil,&#8221; Stump
confided, &#8220;I don&#8217;t believe this here gallows
will ever grow any fruit.&#8221; Stump was about
to say more, but perceiving Klinger riding
his pony toward them, he shuffled awkwardly
away, and began again to direct his native
workmen.</p>

<p>&#8220;Did he mean they ain&#8217;t going to hang
this murderer?&#8221; Marley asked of his friend.</p>

<p>O&#8217;Neil nodded. &#8220;I think he did,&#8221; he replied,
&#8220;and I guess he&#8217;s about right.&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_273">[273]</span>The day before the execution a rumor
passed through the native population that
the man who had killed the black boy would
not be hung, after all.</p>

<p>Alice brought the gossip to the consulate.</p>

<p>&#8220;They would hardly dare a rescue,&#8221; Mr.
Lee declared.</p>

<p>&#8220;O&#8217;Neil said he had heard from Stump, the
man who built the gallows, that it wouldn&#8217;t
be used,&#8221; Phil informed them.</p>

<p>&#8220;Just playing to the gallery, I reckon,&#8221;
Commander Tazewell suggested.</p>

<p>&#8220;If I were only sure the poor fellow won&#8217;t
be hung,&#8221; Alice said earnestly, &#8220;I&#8217;d go and
see the ceremony.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s no place for women,&#8221; Mr. Lee said
reprovingly. &#8220;On the contrary, if I thought
the &#8216;de facto&#8217; government was honest in its
desire to promote the Kapuan morals instead
of making a fiasco out of it, I&#8217;d go and occupy
a front row seat.&#8221;</p>

<p>The next day when Phil and Sydney with
many other curious white men, both from
shore and the war-ships, reached the Malae,
they found gathered a great throng of natives
of both sexes.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_274">[274]</span>&#8220;I guess Stump, O&#8217;Neil and all the rest of
them were wrong,&#8221; Phil said, after they had
taken their seats and noted that the hour set
had nearly arrived. Below the gallows the
prisoner sat in a chair, just as unconcerned
as he had been when he watched the pantomime
rehearsal of his own death. Mr. Carlson,
in full consular uniform, was the only
official present. The king, with the count
seated on his right hand, was a few yards in
front of the gallows. A company of native
soldiers under arms was drawn up near the
high structure. Klinger was standing off by
himself apparently only an interested spectator.</p>

<p>Phil saw Stump behind the prisoner; apparently,
he was to advise the native hangman,
and make sure that there would be no
painful error in the proceedings.</p>

<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s a life for a life,&#8221; Sydney exclaimed
turning almost sick, as he saw the prisoner
jerked to his feet by Johnny Upolu and
his two drilled assistants. The irons were
quickly struck off and the man&#8217;s arms pinioned
in a manner that reflected great credit
upon Johnny. A native band suddenly<span class="pagenum" id="Page_275">[275]</span>
struck up a doleful march, and the death
party, keeping perfect time, moved off to the
very foot of the ladder of the gallows.</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m sorry I came,&#8221; Phil said nervously.
&#8220;I don&#8217;t want to see the poor fellow put to
death.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Look!&#8221; Sydney exclaimed. The Herzovinian
consul had risen and was walking
toward the king. The music suddenly
stopped. The prisoner, held on each side by
a policeman, was stopped, one foot already
upon the ladder to the platform.</p>

<p>The midshipmen gazed in wonder at the
sudden interruption. They saw the consul
present a paper to the king, who quietly read
it, then bowed his affirmative answer.</p>

<p>&#8220;A reprieve,&#8221; Phil exclaimed. &#8220;I&#8217;m glad
of it, and I&#8217;ll never go to another hanging.&#8221;
Both suddenly laughed nervously. They
were glad in their young hearts that the
murderer was not to expiate his crime on the
gallows.</p>

<p>A talking man rose to tell the people. The
midshipmen could not understand a word,
but the effect upon the crowd showed the
news was to their liking. Suddenly several<span class="pagenum" id="Page_276">[276]</span>
voices were raised in song; slowly the volume
increased until every native had joined in. It
was a song of praise for Herzovinia.</p>

<p>&#8220;A play for popularity,&#8221; Sydney said disgustedly
as they moved away toward the road
and back to the landing. &#8220;And another step
toward annexation.&#8221;</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER XVI<br />


<small>CARL KLINGER</small></h2>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">Avao</span> appeared at the consulate one morning
a few days after the count&#8217;s Siva-Siva
dance, her black eyes bright with indignation.</p>

<p>&#8220;See,&#8221; she exclaimed as she handed to
Alice a sheet of paper on which was printed
a dozen or more lines.</p>

<p>Alice read slowly, the color mounting to
her cheeks and her breath coming faster.</p>

<p>&#8220;They have confiscated all of Tuamana&#8217;s
land,&#8221; she exclaimed, &#8220;and branded him a
rebel to the king. This is the official notice
posted about the town.&#8221;</p>

<p>Phil, in spite of the evident seriousness of
this act to the native girl, could not suppress
a smile.</p>

<p>&#8220;Kind of mixed up affair, isn&#8217;t it?&#8221; he said
quietly. &#8220;Rebel Kataafa brands the loyal
Tuamana a rebel.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;This is Klinger&#8217;s work,&#8221; Alice declared.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_278">[278]</span>
&#8220;The land is most valuable, cocoanut and
banana groves, and worth a dollar a tree every
year for the copra alone. There must be over
a thousand trees on the land. It&#8217;s a fortune,
and it is all that Tuamana&#8217;s family possesses.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Can nothing be done?&#8221; Sydney asked
solicitously. &#8220;Where is it located?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Let&#8217;s go and look it over,&#8221; Phil suggested,
&#8220;if it isn&#8217;t far away.&#8221;</p>

<p>The horses were quickly saddled and the
four were soon on the way to visit the family
estate of Tuamana, chief of Ukula.</p>

<p>It was near the sea beach, to the eastward
of Matautu. As they approached the cocoanut
grove they beheld a number of black
boys<a id="FNanchor_35" href="#Footnote_35" class="fnanchor">[35]</a> running barbed wire through new fence
pales, recently set up.</p>

<p>&#8220;They are fencing it off already,&#8221; Alice exclaimed
as they halted their ponies.</p>

<p>Avao pushed her pony across the wire that
had not as yet been stretched, calling to the
others to follow. Very soon they arrived in
front of a very large native house. Several
women sitting within quickly arose and
greeted them.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_279">[279]</span>Avao talked with them for several minutes.</p>

<p>&#8220;My relatives say that Missi Klinger has
ordered them to move their house; that it is
on the Kapuan firm&#8217;s property,&#8221; Avao said,
her voice breaking in mortified anger.</p>

<p>They had all dismounted and several of the
native men had climbed trees to gather fresh
cocoanuts for their visitors.</p>

<p>Suddenly a cry of alarm was raised, and
one of the young natives slid quickly down
the tree and dodged off into the bush. Phil
and his friends had just reached the house
when they heard a hoarse cry of anger, followed
by a loud report as of a pistol discharge.
Phil hurriedly moved until he could
see between trees that the other native was
standing at the foot of the tree into which he
had climbed, and that Klinger was beating
him with his slave whip. The native was
silent, stoically accepting the punishment
from the white man, while yet in his hands
were several green cocoanuts he had just
gathered.</p>

<p>&#8220;Who is the native boy?&#8221; Phil asked of
Avao. He saw her lips were trembling.</p>

<p>&#8220;My cousin,&#8221; she said.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_280">[280]</span>Phil, acting upon a strong impulse to protect
the native, who had been acting in his
own service, turned and rapidly approached
the brutal scene.</p>

<p>&#8220;Mr. Klinger,&#8221; he exclaimed tensely,
&#8220;you will please stop whipping that native
at once. It&#8217;s outrageous. What has he done
to deserve such punishment?&#8221;</p>

<p>With his whip hovering over the bruised
back of the native, Klinger gazed angrily at
the intruder.</p>

<p>&#8220;This is my method of punishing these
rebels who steal my fruit,&#8221; he replied, and
then the cruel whip again fell upon the
native&#8217;s quivering back.</p>

<p>&#8220;Stop it, I say!&#8221; Phil cried determinedly.
&#8220;I shan&#8217;t stand idly by and see you maltreat
that poor fellow. He was gathering his own
fruit for us to eat. You are the one who is
stealing other people&#8217;s fruit, and what&#8217;s more,&#8221;
and Phil&#8217;s voice rose high in indignation, &#8220;if
you don&#8217;t get off of this place and take your
slaves with you, I&#8217;ll whip you with your own
rawhide.&#8221;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_281">[281]</span></p>
<div class="figcenter"><img src="images/i_280.jpg" alt="" /></div>
<p class="caption">&#8220;YOU ARE SIMPLY A BULLY&#8221;</p>

<p>Klinger&#8217;s hand dropped to his side in
sheer dumbfounded amazement. He gazed in
bewilderment at this young man, not able to
realize that such words had been addressed
to him.</p>

<p>Phil made a sign for the native to go, and
the stolid but mystified native smiled in his
pain and moved out of reach of the whip.</p>

<p>&#8220;Now go,&#8221; Phil commanded to Klinger.
&#8220;This place is private property, and you are
trespassing.&#8221; He pointed the way out.</p>

<p>Klinger slowly recovered his balance.
Then a sinister smile spread slowly over his
face.</p>

<p>&#8220;I can show you that you and your friends
are the trespassers,&#8221; he said evenly. &#8220;Here
is my title to the property, signed and executed
by the court.&#8221; He drew forth a paper
from his coat pocket.</p>

<p>Phil gazed squarely into Klinger&#8217;s face unwaveringly.
&#8220;You heard what I said,&#8221; the
young midshipman replied. &#8220;I saw the way
you horsewhipped that inoffensive native; if
I were he I would wait my chance and give
you back two blows for every one received.
You are a brutal coward! Your kind don&#8217;t
fight. You are simply a bully!&#8221;</p>

<p>Klinger, fairly aroused, was now stung<span class="pagenum" id="Page_282">[282]</span>
to action; again he raised his cruel whip,
slinging the long lash behind him and retreating
a step to give the blow fair play.
Phil did not budge. He saw the long leash
raise itself as if alive from the ground; he
heard it sing in the air above him, expecting
it to wrap itself stinging and biting about his
neck. But it passed harmlessly a few inches
from his shoulder and fell upon the ground
at his feet with a dull report. Then he could
hardly believe his eyes, for his antagonist was
rolling on the ground, a naked brown body
clinging desperately to him.</p>

<p>Phil was transfixed in astonishment. His
first intention, to go to the aid of the native,
he saw was unnecessary. The supple native
boy had found his strength and was slowly
choking the breath from the manager&#8217;s body.
Klinger&#8217;s face had turned purple before Phil
could persuade the injured native to desist.
The boy was fairly delirious with savage joy
over his wonderful achievement. Klinger
lay insensible upon the ground. Phil
stooped, the manager&#8217;s whip in his own
hands, and tore the man&#8217;s shirt at the
neck and felt for his heart. He feared that<span class="pagenum" id="Page_283">[283]</span>
some permanent injury might have been done
him.</p>

<p>Sydney and the others were now at Phil&#8217;s
side. Avao openly praised the native boy for
his prowess, and Phil learned that a command
from her had sent this young bundle of steel
muscles to protect him from the manager&#8217;s
cruel whip. The native grinned for joy. He
had discovered his own manhood and protected
a papalangi friend of the queen of his
clan from a ruffianly slave driver.</p>

<p>&#8220;He&#8217;s nearly choked to death,&#8221; Phil announced
as he rose to his feet. &#8220;That boy
has the strength of a young gorilla in his
hands. Look at those marks on Klinger&#8217;s
neck.&#8221;</p>

<p>The manager&#8217;s neck was a sorry sight; the
cords and muscles had been twisted and almost
pulled bodily from the broad throat.</p>

<p>&#8220;He&#8217;ll have an awfully sore throat when
he wakes up,&#8221; Sydney said quietly.</p>

<p>&#8220;We must get him to a doctor at once,&#8221;
Phil exclaimed. &#8220;Avao, call to those slave
boys. We must have him carried to town.&#8221;</p>

<p>The Tapau called, and several of the blacks
started toward them.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_284">[284]</span>Then Phil thought of the native boy who
had come to his aid. He feared for him. He
knew that some cruel and unheard-of punishment
would be given to the native that dared
to so roughly handle the manager of the
Kapuan firm. Death even was not impossible,
especially as the native was a relative
of Tuamana.</p>

<p>&#8220;Avao,&#8221; he whispered, &#8220;tell the boy to go
away far and not come back until you send
him word.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;He knows, Alii,&#8221; Avao replied. The boy
pressed his forehead hurriedly to the girl&#8217;s
hand, and then murmuring, &#8220;Tofa, Alii,&#8221;<a id="FNanchor_36" href="#Footnote_36" class="fnanchor">[36]</a>
with a cheerful grin vanished into the &#8220;bush,&#8221;
just as the first of the Solomon Islanders
arrived to raise their fallen master.</p>

<p>With Klinger carried on the shoulders of
several black boys, and with the Americans
bringing up the rear, the party proceeded
toward the town.</p>

<p>Fortunately a carriage was hitched at the
British consulate and the driver sitting in
the shade near by. They put Klinger inside,
while Phil and Sydney remained to support<span class="pagenum" id="Page_285">[285]</span>
him, and thus they drove hurriedly to
Klinger&#8217;s residence back of the store.</p>

<p>&#8220;This isn&#8217;t going to improve the kind feeling
between us and the &#8216;de facto&#8217; government,&#8221;
Phil said.</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m glad you are not responsible,&#8221; Sydney
declared.</p>

<p>&#8220;But I was,&#8221; Phil insisted. &#8220;I goaded him
on to strike me. I had an irresistible desire
to take his whip and give him a plentiful
taste of his own medicine. He would have
struck me, too. I saw it in his eyes. He
has an ungovernable temper, and was clean
off his head.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Why will you be so rash?&#8221; Sydney asked
affectionately. &#8220;Some day you&#8217;re going to
get into serious trouble.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I can&#8217;t help it, Syd,&#8221; Phil answered
soberly. &#8220;Such acts as that, beating an inoffensive
native, make my blood boil, and I&#8217;m
thankful I have the courage and strength to
interfere. You would have done it too, Syd,&#8221;
he exclaimed, &#8220;if you had seen it before I did.&#8221;</p>

<p>Sydney shook his head. &#8220;No,&#8221; he replied.
&#8220;My blood is more sluggish than yours. You
did exactly right though, Phil.&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_286">[286]</span>Phil was silent for a moment. Klinger&#8217;s
face was now regaining its color, but his body
was still limp and his eyes closed.</p>

<p>&#8220;Syd,&#8221; Phil said quietly, &#8220;you are really
more solid than I. You reflect before you
act. I too frequently act upon impulse without
reflection.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You act, though, only upon good impulses,&#8221;
Sydney replied.</p>

<p>The carriage stopped in front of the Kapuan
firm&#8217;s store, and a couple of bystanders were
impressed to carry the injured man inside.</p>

<p>&#8220;Go tell the &#8216;fomai,&#8217;&#8221; Phil instructed a native
woman, and she departed quickly to obey.</p>

<p>&#8220;Shall we wait?&#8221; Phil asked nervously.
This part of the ordeal was trying for the
midshipman.</p>

<p>&#8220;I guess we must,&#8221; Sydney replied. &#8220;We
shall have to explain how it happened.&#8221;</p>

<p>Phil frowned. &#8220;I&#8217;m not going to reveal the
identity of that native boy. Maybe Klinger
did not recognize him.&#8221;</p>

<p>The manager had been carried into his own
room, while Fanua, his native wife, hovered
over him anxiously. She gazed in open distrust
upon the two officers.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_287">[287]</span>&#8220;Here comes the little doctor,&#8221; Sydney exclaimed
in relief, as the same fat, middle-aged
man that had before restored the injured
Klinger after his earlier encounter with Phil
pushed his way through the crowd of inquisitive
natives, and entered the room.</p>

<p>Klinger had opened his eyes. The pain in
his throat made him cry out weakly.</p>

<p>The doctor examined the injured man&#8217;s
neck in silence.</p>

<p>&#8220;A black boy run &#8216;amuck&#8217;<a id="FNanchor_37" href="#Footnote_37" class="fnanchor">[37]</a>?&#8221; he asked
after he had finished the examination. &#8220;It
looks as if a whole gang had risen against him.&#8221;</p>

<p>Klinger tried to speak, but his voice failed.</p>

<p>&#8220;We&#8217;ll leave now,&#8221; Phil returned. His
nerves were under tension. He felt no sympathy
for Klinger, yet wished to avoid a disagreeable
scene with the injured man. &#8220;I
shall be ready to give my story whenever it is
asked for. Good-day, sir.&#8221;</p>

<p>Sydney followed Phil from the room.</p>

<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s a relief to get away,&#8221; Phil declared.</p>

<p>They went at once to the ship and told their
story to Commander Tazewell.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_288">[288]</span>&#8220;That isn&#8217;t the only land grabbing the
Kapuan firm has been indulging in,&#8221; he informed
them. &#8220;Our lease of land at Tua-Tua
in Kulila has been declared illegal by Kataafa
and affirmed by the acting chief justice,
Count Rosen. The Kapuan firm, I hear,
brought in evidence of a prior claim of purchase.
Of course it&#8217;s a trick, but we can&#8217;t
prove that before an interested judge.&#8221;</p>

<p>The midshipmen drew in their breath in
surprise. Evidently the land grabbing was
not confined to property owned by uninfluential
natives.</p>

<p>&#8220;I have searched all morning,&#8221; the commander
exclaimed annoyedly, &#8220;for the lease
signed by Moanga, the chief of Tua-Tua, who
owns the property. I took it from the safe
yesterday and thought I had returned it there,
but it is not in the regular envelope. Probably
it is only mislaid, and I shall find it
among my other papers. I&#8217;m afraid I&#8217;m
getting careless. A natural effect of this
torrid climate.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Are you going to dispute the claim?&#8221;
Phil asked.</p>

<p>&#8220;That was my intention,&#8221; Commander<span class="pagenum" id="Page_289">[289]</span>
Tazewell replied, &#8220;but the lease is a private
one between Chief Moanga and myself. It
must be confirmed at home before money is
appropriated. Of course I acted under instructions
from the Navy Department. It&#8217;s
embarrassing not to find the paper, because I
cannot register an appeal very well without
it.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Do you believe it has been stolen?&#8221; Phil
asked earnestly. His thoughts had gone to
the orderly Schultz.</p>

<p>&#8220;That isn&#8217;t likely,&#8221; the commander said,
shaking his head. &#8220;No one has access to my
cabin while I&#8217;m not here except a few
trusted men who keep it clean, and my
orderlies, and all of them are men with excellent
records. No,&#8221; he added certainly.
&#8220;It&#8217;ll turn up; it&#8217;s probably in a wrong
envelope, and I&#8217;ll find it after more search.</p>

<p>&#8220;So Klinger has again come to grief
through you,&#8221; he said to Phil suppressing a
smile of gratification. &#8220;I am glad you did
not carry out the threat you made. I wouldn&#8217;t
care to have my officers engage in fights with
civilians. It doesn&#8217;t look well outside, even
though it may have been justified.&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_290">[290]</span>Phil acknowledged the mild rebuke.</p>

<p>&#8220;I know I&#8217;m too hasty,&#8221; he said humbly.</p>

<p>The next day news came from ashore that
all the male relatives of Tuamana had been
arrested for the assault on Klinger and thrown
into jail. The house the midshipmen had
visited the day before had been demolished
by order of Klinger, and the women turned
off the place.</p>

<p>Alice was keyed to a high pitch of excitement
when the lads saw her in the afternoon.</p>

<p>&#8220;They tried to arrest Avao, too,&#8221; she exclaimed,
&#8220;but she ran away and managed to
reach the consulate, where they dared not
touch her. All the land belonging to Panu&#8217;s
family in Matafeli has been claimed by
Klinger for his firm,&#8221; she told them almost
in a breath. &#8220;Where will it all stop?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It won&#8217;t stop,&#8221; Phil replied savagely,
&#8220;until the present outfit are put out and the
legal government is put in. The treaty is
being violated right and left. I can&#8217;t see
what this man Count Rosen expects to gain
by it. The three great Powers when they
hear what is going on down here must decide
that the high-handedness of Rosen and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_291">[291]</span>
Klinger have only made things more difficult
to adjust.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Maybe that&#8217;s where the count expects to
gain,&#8221; Alice said seriously. &#8220;Maybe their
country wishes to make difficulties&mdash;to show
the other nations that three countries cannot
together run one little group of islands without
war and bloodshed.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I, for the life of me,&#8221; Sydney declared,
&#8220;cannot see why the United States and England
don&#8217;t pull up stakes and leave the islands
to Herzovinia. I know we have our eyes
on the fine harbor of Tua-Tua, but I can&#8217;t see
when we are going to use it.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Maybe you can&#8217;t see!&#8221; Phil replied sarcastically,
&#8220;and one reason you can&#8217;t see is
that you haven&#8217;t given it a minute&#8217;s thought.
Herzovinia has a body of intelligent men in
her government whose duty it is to study
such questions. It is quite evident those
men have advised their nation to endeavor
to acquire Kapua, and this is her way of trying
to acquire it. The captain of the British
war-ship told us the other day that he had
seen their machinery of annexation work
over in Africa.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_292">[292]</span>&#8220;First comes the merchant, pushing his
way in by brute strength and awkwardness,
shoving out all other merchants by staying
close to his job. Then a row between the
merchants and the natives, followed closely
by the arrival of a war-ship. Then a punitive
expedition against the natives who have dared
to resent the oppression of the merchants.
Then diplomatic correspondence assuring other
nations there is no thought of acquisition of
territory and then all of a sudden up goes the
Herzovinian flag, and the thing has been accomplished.
As I said before,&#8221; Phil ended
his impromptu speech, &#8220;I can&#8217;t see why the
count hesitates about hoisting his flag. We
can&#8217;t stop him. We haven&#8217;t men enough.&#8221;</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER XVII<br />


<small>BEN STUMP LISTENS</small></h2>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">Carl Klinger</span> paced the porch of the
count&#8217;s home in visible annoyance. Count
Rosen surveyed the angry overseer complacently
from his easy chair under the shade of
the thatched roof porch.</p>

<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t be an idiot, Klinger,&#8221; he said.
&#8220;You can&#8217;t afford to indulge in personal
vengeance. The American officer has gotten
ahead of you and put you to shame before
the natives, and I think you deserved it.
Your work was childish. Putting that cartoon
on your wall was bad enough, but to attempt
to thrash a native relative of Tuamana under
the eyes of his own friends and supporters
was infantile. If you don&#8217;t stop swearing
vengeance upon that young midshipman
I&#8217;ll be forced to lock you up in your own
house and put a guard over you. To attempt
such barefaced outlawry as an attack upon
the person of an American naval officer by<span class="pagenum" id="Page_294">[294]</span>
hired thugs would only lead to intervention
by the war-ships.&#8221;</p>

<p>Klinger sulked in silence, and the count
continued:</p>

<p>&#8220;The last mail steamer carried Kataafa&#8217;s
appeal for annexation. It was to be cabled
from San Francisco to our government. An
answer should reach here now in a few days.
The news of the war of course is now known
everywhere, but I am sure our own war-ship
with instructions for us will arrive first. The
United States may beat us, but upon the appearance
of a Yankee ship I&#8217;m going to
hoist the flag. Even sooner if I hear from
our man on the Yankee ship anything alarming.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Why do you take such chances?&#8221; Klinger
asked surlily. &#8220;We&#8217;re in power. The English
and Americans are afraid to act without
orders from home. Hoist the flag and be done
with it!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Klinger,&#8221; the count replied haughtily,
&#8220;as long as you keep within your limitations
as a manager of a commercial firm, grabbing
land from defenseless natives and using it to
increase the income of your company, then I<span class="pagenum" id="Page_295">[295]</span>
am willing to listen to your advice, but when
you make bold to advise me upon matters
of state, you make yourself ridiculous.
This savage kingdom is isolated from the great
world,&#8221; he continued in a more kindly tone
of explanation as he saw the look of apology
in the rough overseer&#8217;s face. &#8220;The nearest
cable stations are San Francisco and Auckland;
news of what has happened reached our
capital before or as soon as it was received in
Washington or London. A Herzovinian war-ship
has been waiting in Auckland to bring
us instructions. I do not know the present
diplomatic situation. If I hoist the flag before
the arrival of the war-ship, I may find the
instructions are not to hoist the flag. We may
be on the verge of a war with our commercial
rival England over some other diplomatic difficulty,
and our action here might greatly embarrass
our foreign office.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But you said,&#8221; Klinger persisted, &#8220;you
would hoist the flag upon the appearance of
a Yankee war-ship.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;The arrival of another Yankee war-ship
must mean but one thing,&#8221; the count replied
patiently, &#8220;and that would be that the United<span class="pagenum" id="Page_296">[296]</span>
States government had decided to back the
decision of the chief justice and put Panu-Mafili
on the throne by force. In that case I
would have to resign. Kataafa would either
have to submit or else fight the white sailors.
If the new arrival sees our flag flying and our
sailors in possession, then the Americans and
British must stop and think a long time before
they use force to drive us out of the government.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;And then after that if your instructions
coming on our war-ship should be not to hoist
the flag?&#8221; Klinger asked. &#8220;What then?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Then I shall send a war-ship to Auckland
post-haste to tell what I have done, and to
wait for an answer, and then hasten back here.&#8221;
The count smiled proudly as his plan unfolded
itself. &#8220;Our government could then wait to
see how the news was received. If they saw
it was embarrassing they could order the flag
hauled down. If not, then it would remain
flying permanently.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I have that lease of land at Tua-Tua made
by Chief Moanga to the American captain,&#8221;
Klinger said jubilantly, showing the document,
&#8220;and Scott has gone across to get<span class="pagenum" id="Page_297">[297]</span>
Moanga&#8217;s signature to one I drew up for the
&#8216;firm,&#8217; and to destroy the other duplicate.&#8221;</p>

<p>The count nodded. &#8220;Tua-Tua we should
keep, but the United States government may
succeed in getting the island of Kulila after
all. She has had her eyes on it for many
years, and doubtless thinks her claim is first.
We would not fight her for it, so unless we can
win out through diplomacy it will be hers.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Little good it will do her,&#8221; Klinger said
savagely, &#8220;when the Kapuan firm owns the
only water-front that is not full of quicksand.&#8221;</p>

<p>The count chuckled. &#8220;We statesmen can
always receive a lesson from a clever merchant.
No doubt the United States will be forced to
pay a fancy price for your land when she
makes up her mind to build a naval station
there. By the way,&#8221; he added, &#8220;I thought
Scott was intent upon saving his skin, and had
sailed for the Fijis.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;That was his intention,&#8221; Klinger replied,
&#8220;but he ran into Fangaloa Bay for water, and
heard you owned the government; so he sent
me word he was staying around to get a cargo
of copra, and incidentally to coax back his
mate Stump.&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_298">[298]</span>&#8220;And you sent him to Tua-Tua on a mission
to Chief Moanga?&#8221; the count asked pointedly.
&#8220;What does he receive for that
service?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Stump,&#8221; Klinger replied. &#8220;He also got
a cargo of copra to be landed in Suva.&#8221;</p>

<p>The count shook his head doubtfully.
&#8220;That&#8217;s a serious business, to seize an American
and &#8216;shanghai&#8217; him,&#8221; he said.</p>

<p>&#8220;It will be done without force,&#8221; Klinger explained.
&#8220;Stump is in our employ. He&#8217;s
trying to pay his way back to America. I&#8217;ll
have him in Fangaloa on some plantation
work, and let Scott do his own shanghaiing.
Scott should be back at Fangaloa to-day unless
he had trouble persuading Moanga.&#8221;</p>

<p>The portly figure of Mr. Carlson emerged
from the palm and banana grove in front of
the bungalow. A few seconds later he arrived
on the porch, puffing and blowing from his
exertions. As the count and the overseer
turned to greet him, none too graciously, the
figure of a man unrolled itself from the tapa
draperies of a window opening on to the porch,
and silently withdrew through the kitchen in
the rear.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_299">[299]</span>Stump, for it was he, held in his hand a
hammer and nails, and unconcernedly told
the native cook that he would come back to
make imaginary repairs.</p>

<p>After the mate had put several hundreds
of yards between himself and the governor&#8217;s
house, he stopped and called down all manner
of vengeance upon Klinger&#8217;s head. Then he
took a wide d&eacute;tour arriving breathless at the
landing, hired a boat and was soon in Commander
Tazewell&#8217;s cabin.</p>

<p>While Stump retailed the conversation he
had heard between the count and Klinger,
Commander Tazewell&#8217;s indignation mounted
higher and higher. When he heard of the
plan to rob his government of Tua-Tua as a
coaling station and the fact that his contract
had fallen into Klinger&#8217;s hands, the commander&#8217;s
brows gathered in a perplexed frown.
There must be a spy on his own ship! In
no other way could the paper have been
stolen from his cabin.</p>

<p>Phil, answering the commander&#8217;s summons,
was soon informed of Stump&#8217;s exciting news.</p>

<p>The commander was disappointed in seeing
no surprise in Phil&#8217;s face when he heard<span class="pagenum" id="Page_300">[300]</span>
that the Tua-Tua lease was in Klinger&#8217;s
hands.</p>

<p>&#8220;Then you have suspected that there is a
spy on board this ship,&#8221; the commander exclaimed
incredulously, &#8220;and have not confided
your suspicions to me! I&#8217;m surprised
and disappointed in you, Mr. Perry,&#8221; he added
accusingly.</p>

<p>Phil flushed guiltily. &#8220;It was really not
a suspicion, sir,&#8221; he stammeringly answered,
&#8220;and has only developed into a suspicion
after listening to the news Stump here
brings.&#8221;</p>

<p>The lad then detailed what had occurred
the night the &#8220;Talofa&#8221; and Captain Scott
had entered the harbor, when he had thought
he had surprised Schultz, the captain&#8217;s orderly,
endeavoring to listen to the conversation between
Commander Tazewell and the British
commander.</p>

<p>&#8220;His explanation, sir,&#8221; he added, &#8220;was so
readily given, that I thought I had been mistaken.
Then when I learned his name was
Schultz, the suspicion returned; only that
didn&#8217;t seem sufficient proof to accuse him
of spying. When you told me earlier of the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_301">[301]</span>
loss of the lease I again thought of Schultz,
but you seemed to think the paper was only
mislaid. I&#8217;m sorry, sir,&#8221; Phil stammered in
embarrassment. &#8220;I see now I should have
made a clean breast of it before.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t worry over that, Perry,&#8221; Commander
Tazewell said kindly. &#8220;Hindsight,
you know, is always better than foresight.
If I had been you I doubt if I should have
acted differently, so I have no right to blame
you. I know you are loyal, and will always
act in a way that seems to you right and
straightforward.&#8221;</p>

<p>Stump had been sent forward to seek out
O&#8217;Neil. The captain had desired that the
mate remain on board the &#8220;Sitka&#8221; for the
present, a request which Stump was only too
happy to accept.</p>

<p>&#8220;The most serious part of this news,&#8221; Commander
Tazewell exclaimed, &#8220;is that it shows
the whole plot unearthed, and yet I don&#8217;t see
any way now to thwart the conspirators.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Where&#8217;s the &#8216;Sacramento&#8217;?&#8221; Phil asked
excitedly.</p>

<p>&#8220;At last accounts, in Honolulu, or at least
expected there. She sailed from Panama some<span class="pagenum" id="Page_302">[302]</span>
weeks ago,&#8221; Commander Tazewell replied
thoughtfully. &#8220;There&#8217;s no cable to Honolulu,
so if she is to come here, word must be
dispatched by steamer from San Francisco.
If Stump has heard correctly, the count knew
that a Herzovinian war-ship was waiting in
Auckland to bring the government&#8217;s orders
to annex or not to annex. That, according to
the count, would depend upon the diplomatic
conditions. Of course,&#8221; the commander added,
&#8220;there can be no question of a European war
over Kapua. The thing would be impossible,
and not worth the life of a single soldier or
sailor.&#8221;</p>

<p>Phil shook his head, much puzzled over
the situation.</p>

<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s all very confusing to me, sir,&#8221; the
lad said. &#8220;The personal feelings between the
Herzovinians on one side and the English
and ourselves on the other are so strongly
antagonistic that I&#8217;m sure if we were put
ashore together and left there for a week we
would be fighting, although for the life of me
I can&#8217;t see what it would be about. I haven&#8217;t
any personal interest in Kapua and really
admire the Herzovinians greatly, yet I am as<span class="pagenum" id="Page_303">[303]</span>
antagonistic as any one to her getting the
islands.&#8221;</p>

<p>Commander Tazewell laughed in high
amusement. &#8220;Yes,&#8221; he replied, &#8220;it is remarkable
how men isolated as we are focus
our minds upon local affairs that should not
really influence us. Here am I, out of cable
communication with Washington. I see this
nation through private individuals plot to
take over a group of islands in which the
country I represent has one-third share. If I
precipitate a fight with a foreign power in
order to retain that one-third right given us
by treaty, I may find upon receipt of mail that
the government has decided to relinquish its
claim. Meanwhile through my action blood
may have been spilled.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Why does a government, like ours especially,
so often change its mind in these international
affairs?&#8221; Phil asked.</p>

<p>&#8220;It doesn&#8217;t change its mind often,&#8221; the
commander smilingly replied, &#8220;for it seldom
makes up its mind. There is one thing, Mr.
Perry, that few people seem to thoroughly
understand, and our government has always
disregarded. It is the relation between our<span class="pagenum" id="Page_304">[304]</span>
international acts and our armed forces: the
army and navy.</p>

<p>&#8220;If there exists a large army and a navy
to back up our demands, then the other countries
will cheerfully grant them, but if the
army and navy are small and weak, then the
demands are not granted.&#8221;</p>

<p>Phil nodded his head. He was having explained
a problem over which he had long
puzzled.</p>

<p>&#8220;So you believe then that whether Herzovinia
gets Kapua or loses it depends upon
the relative power of her army and navy?&#8221;
he asked.</p>

<p>&#8220;Exactly; if she wants to seize Kapua I
don&#8217;t see any way to stop it,&#8221; Commander
Tazewell answered. &#8220;Whether she will hold
it or not must depend upon how highly England
and the United States appraise the value
of the Herzovinian army and navy to back
up her act. If we think she is in earnest
and will go to war rather than give up Kapua,
then our statesmen must decide what will be
the advantages or disadvantages of war to
us.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But,&#8221; Phil exclaimed, &#8220;she couldn&#8217;t fight<span class="pagenum" id="Page_305">[305]</span>
both the United States and England, all at
once.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;There, you see, is the true value of her
great army and navy,&#8221; Commander Tazewell
answered solemnly. &#8220;The two great nations
might be able to defeat her, but it would not
stop there. Probably many other nations of
Europe would become involved.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Then if Herzovinia had only a small
army and navy,&#8221; Phil said questioningly,
&#8220;the United States or England would pay
no attention to her demands, and she would
be forced to give in.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s the whole thing in a nutshell,&#8221;
the commander exclaimed. &#8220;Let us hope,
Perry,&#8221; he added, &#8220;our great nation will be
sensible enough to keep always a strong army
and navy, so that we can be assured that we
can do right without the need of asking some
other nation&#8217;s permission.&#8221;</p>

<p>As Commander Tazewell paused he unrolled
a chart and spread it before him on the cabin
table.</p>

<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s nearly twenty miles from here to Fangaloa
Bay,&#8221; he said after a few minutes&#8217; silent
scrutiny of the chart of the Kapuan Islands.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_306">[306]</span>Phil was at once keenly alert. What was
in Commander Tazewell&#8217;s mind?</p>

<p>&#8220;I believe I am fully justified in seizing
Scott and his schooner, and with Stump a
witness against him we could try him for
something very near piracy.&#8221; Commander
Tazewell smiled amusedly as he regarded
Phil&#8217;s eager face, and was prepared for the
lad&#8217;s earnest question.</p>

<p>&#8220;Will you go there with the ship?&#8221; Phil
asked.</p>

<p>&#8220;No,&#8221; the commander replied. &#8220;I&#8217;m thinking
of sending you on a &#8216;cutting out&#8217; expedition
to bring back Scott and the schooner,
either or both. Will you accept the job?&#8221;</p>

<p>Phil fairly beamed with joyful anticipation,
but he composed himself and answered:</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m ready to go anywhere you send me,
sir.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Schultz had best be watched,&#8221; the commander
added. &#8220;It&#8217;s wiser not to show him
that we suspect him. He may help us to
find out something to our advantage concerning
our friends, the count and Klinger.</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll tell the executive officer to let you
have the steam launch, and he will get it<span class="pagenum" id="Page_307">[307]</span>
ready for you beginning after dark. You
can select the men you wish to go with you.
Tuamana can pilot the launch through the
reef at Fangaloa. Is there any suggestion
you wish to make?&#8221; the commander asked
as Phil arose to go from the cabin.</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;d like to have Mr. Monroe go along to
keep me company,&#8221; Phil replied quickly,
&#8220;and I thought it might be wise to go ashore
now and try to find out from Avao or Mary
Hamilton whether the &#8216;Talofa&#8217; has reached
Fangaloa on her return from her trip to Tua-Tua.&#8221;</p>

<p>Commander Tazewell readily agreed with
the lad&#8217;s suggestions. &#8220;I&#8217;ll see you before
you shove off to-night,&#8221; he said. &#8220;And don&#8217;t
get hurt. Scott and his schooner aren&#8217;t worth
it.&#8221;</p>

<p>Phil found Sydney and told him all the
good news, and then sent for O&#8217;Neil and
Stump.</p>

<p>The mate gleefully volunteered to go along.</p>

<p>&#8220;Can I navigate a schooner!&#8221; he exclaimed.
&#8220;Didn&#8217;t I bring her into Ukula harbor on
the darkest tropical night I ever saw with
only the white line of surf as buoys? I&#8217;ll sail<span class="pagenum" id="Page_308">[308]</span>
her back for you, and sit on old &#8216;Bully&#8217;
Scott&#8217;s face while I&#8217;m doing it.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;He&#8217;d be handy to show us where the gear
is located, sir,&#8221; O&#8217;Neil said approvingly, &#8220;and
besides, he knows the crew and can speak
their &#8216;lingo.&#8217;&#8221;</p>

<p>The two midshipmen after having been
interviewed by the executive officer, who had
come to think highly of the activity of his
two young subordinates, were set on shore
and at once sought their friend, Alice Lee, to
find out what news she had gathered from
her native friends.</p>

<p>They found her in the hammock in the
&#8220;lanai,&#8221; deep in a book. She greeted them
without reserve.</p>

<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s about time you came,&#8221; she exclaimed.
&#8220;I&#8217;ve been bursting with news for you.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;What is it?&#8221; they both asked eagerly.</p>

<p>&#8220;I tried to go up on Mission Hill this
afternoon and was refused,&#8221; Alice declared
excitedly. &#8220;The count has established a
&#8216;lookout&#8217; station there. I saw half a dozen
Herzovinian sailors with a long spy-glass
mounted on a tripod; and I saw signal flags
too,&#8221; she added.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_309">[309]</span>The midshipmen exchanged glances.</p>

<p>&#8220;Looking for the &#8216;Sacramento,&#8217;&#8221; Sydney
exclaimed. Then they told Alice of the conversation
Stump had overheard and of their
mission for that evening.</p>

<p>&#8220;That isn&#8217;t all my news,&#8221; Alice said
proudly. &#8220;One of the &#8216;Talofa&#8217;s&#8217; crew, a Fiji
Islander, arrived in Ukula, and Klinger rode
away with him toward Saluafata. Mary
Hamilton came and told me that an hour
ago.&#8221;</p>

<p>The two lads shook hands with each other
in boyish excitement and joy, while Alice
looked on thinking they had suddenly gone
crazy.</p>

<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t you see,&#8221; Phil explained to Alice&#8217;s
inquiry. &#8220;Scott and his schooner are back,
and Klinger is going to get the lease and explain
that Stump will come later. We&#8217;ll
catch the schooner anyway, and maybe Scott
and the lease will also be on board.&#8221;</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER XVIII<br />


<small>A &#8220;CUTTING OUT&#8221; EXPEDITION</small></h2>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">Four</span> bells was struck on board the &#8220;Sitka,&#8221;
as the steam launch quietly shoved off from
the gangway.</p>

<p>The launch had been stripped of its bulky
canopy and lay lean and low in the water.
No lights were shown, and in the darkness
the little craft hoped to leave the harbor unobserved.</p>

<p>&#8220;What&#8217;s that for?&#8221; Sydney suddenly exclaimed
in alarm.</p>

<p>The &#8220;Sitka&#8221; had turned on all her search-lights
and was sweeping them in small arcs
over the shipping and along the shore line.</p>

<p>Phil chuckled.</p>

<p>&#8220;Throwing sand in their eyes,&#8221; he said.
&#8220;See that light held stationary on our &#8216;lookout&#8217;
hill. They can&#8217;t see us with that illumination
in their faces. There&#8217;s another light
playing over the Herzovinian war-ship and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_311">[311]</span>
another on the Matafeli district where the
count lives. It&#8217;s just a measure of safety. I
heard Commander Tazewell give the order
for it as we left the cabin a few minutes ago.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Those search-lights will nearly put your
eyes out,&#8221; O&#8217;Neil declared. &#8220;When I was serving
in a torpedo boat destroyer during the war
man&#339;uvers we used to run full speed toward
a battle-ship after we had sighted her steaming
along with no lights showing. Then when
she saw us and turned her search-lights on us,
there was nothing doing. We couldn&#8217;t see
nothing, and we didn&#8217;t know how far we were
away.&#8221;</p>

<p>The launch cleared the reefs at the entrance,
and stood to the eastward. The craft was under
the pilotage of Chief Tuamana, who had
been delighted to aid his white friends against
those he assumed to be his enemies. A course
was laid from the chart to take them clear of
the reef, and also far enough away so as not to
be observed by natives fishing along its edge.</p>

<p>&#8220;Commander Tazewell especially cautioned
secrecy,&#8221; Phil said, as he directed O&#8217;Neil,
who was at the helm, to give the reef a wide
berth. &#8220;We are to act only at night, and surprise<span class="pagenum" id="Page_312">[312]</span>
old man Scott. The natives on shore
are to know nothing of our move.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;What&#8217;s the idea of that?&#8221; Sydney asked.</p>

<p>&#8220;The fear that if the count heard we had
cut out the &#8216;Talofa&#8217; he might use it as an excuse
to precipitate matters, I suppose,&#8221; Phil
replied. &#8220;He could give the episode vivid
coloring and claim he had hoisted his nation&#8217;s
flag to prevent the high-handed and lawless
acts of the American and English naval commanders.
It would sound well to those who
didn&#8217;t know all the particulars. Of course,&#8221;
Phil added, &#8220;another reason is that if we are
seen, Scott may be informed and might resist
us by force, and then the situation wouldn&#8217;t
be so simple; especially if he should use natives
of Kataafa&#8217;s side to resist us.&#8221;</p>

<p>Sydney contemplated in silence the gunner&#8217;s
mate at his side who was critically examining
a machine gun on its portable tripod.</p>

<p>&#8220;The executive seems to have supplied us
with enough force to overcome resistance,&#8221; the
midshipman declared quietly. &#8220;A machine
gun and ten sailors with rifles should easily
overpower Captain Scott and his crew.&#8221;</p>

<p>Stump had listened in silence. Hearing<span class="pagenum" id="Page_313">[313]</span>
Sydney&#8217;s observation he joined in the conversation.</p>

<p>&#8220;You&#8217;ll need all you&#8217;ve got to get ahead of
&#8216;Bully&#8217; Scott,&#8221; he exclaimed wagging his head
sagely, &#8220;unless you surprise him. This here
&#8216;Bully&#8217; Scott is a tough man to go fooling
with. I seen him lay out nearly a dozen natives
in the Solomon Islands. They were all
trying to kill him with head knives and war
clubs. He&#8217;s a dead shot with a revolver, and
he usually carries two of them.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I reckon he will not resist us, Stump,&#8221;
Phil said confidently. &#8220;We represent the
law, you see, and if he hurts any one, he&#8217;ll be
liable to a long term in jail.&#8221;</p>

<p>Stump laughed mirthlessly.</p>

<p>&#8220;He&#8217;s entitled to that already,&#8221; he exclaimed.
&#8220;That&#8217;s why he wants to lay his
hands on me. And if he should,&#8221; the mate
added with an involuntary shiver, &#8220;the
&#8216;Talofa&#8217; would arrive at its next port and
&#8216;Bully&#8217; Scott with tears in his eyes would tell
of the loss of his dear friend Stump, drowned
at sea.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;What&#8217;s the plan, Phil?&#8221; Sydney asked
some time later.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_314">[314]</span>&#8220;We go first to Fangaloa Bay. If the
&#8216;Talofa&#8217;s&#8217; there we simply seize her and every
one on board and take her back to Ukula
harbor,&#8221; Phil replied.</p>

<p>&#8220;That sounds simple enough,&#8221; O&#8217;Neil declared,
&#8220;and, Mr. Perry, it&#8217;ll be just as easy as
saying it. Only,&#8221; he added jokingly, &#8220;we&#8217;ll
have to keep our eyes on Stump. He&#8217;s likely
to get mixed up with his old friend and shipmate
&#8216;Bully&#8217; Scott.&#8221;</p>

<p>The night was extremely dark, but the
thunder of the surf on the reef guided them
in keeping beyond that peril. The land
loomed dark on the starboard hand, while overhead
a brilliant starry sky accentuated the
blackness of the night. Ashore, bright lights
sprang up from time to time, revealing the location
of native villages along the beach.</p>

<p>Tuamana, a cape of native cloth slung picturesquely
over his shoulders, stood silently
beside O&#8217;Neil. The chief&#8217;s eyes were continually
upon the shore line. He was for the
most part silent, but would occasionally turn
to Phil, pointing to a group of lights ashore
or to a deeper shadow against the loom of the
land and inform him shortly of their bearings.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_315">[315]</span>&#8220;Saluafata,&#8221; he said as the thunder of the
breaking surf grew louder and a ghastly
whiteness appeared on the bow.</p>

<p>Phil glanced at his watch. &#8220;Eleven
thirty,&#8221; he said. &#8220;We&#8217;re about half-way.&#8221;</p>

<p>Most of the crew had curled themselves
down in the bottom of the boat and lay
motionless. Phil envied them. Even with
the prospect of a hand to hand fight, against
what odds they could not know, their healthy
minds were wrapped in sleep.</p>

<p>&#8220;What brought Captain Scott back,
Stump?&#8221; Phil asked after an unbroken
silence of some minutes. &#8220;He was supposed
to have left the islands after landing the guns.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Klinger said Scott heard that the Herzovinians
owned the government, and that
he was therefore safe to come and get his
copra,&#8221; Stump answered. &#8220;But I know that
he&#8217;s looking for me. I know too much.
I&#8217;ve seen more than one poor black boy
kicked overboard when Scott was in one of
his wild fits of anger.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Why have you stayed so long with such a
brute?&#8221; Sydney asked.</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, sir,&#8221; Stump replied, &#8220;I reckon I<span class="pagenum" id="Page_316">[316]</span>
was always too scared to run away. And
then,&#8221; he added fearfully, &#8220;I&#8217;ve got a few
things to answer for, too. I was driven to
&#8217;em, but before a court that don&#8217;t count. I
hain&#8217;t got murder, though,&#8221; he declared.
&#8220;&#8217;Tain&#8217;t in no way as bad as that. Captain
Scott swears I shoved a black boy overboard
in a gale of wind, but &#8217;fore God, it was an
accident, and I asked to lower a boat and go
after him, but Scott wouldn&#8217;t let me. I&#8217;ve
done with it, and am willing to take whatever
medicine is coming.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Fangaloa,&#8221; Tuamana grunted, pointing to
the dim outline of a high cone-shaped mountain
looming up on the starboard hand.</p>

<p>The word soon spread among the sleeping
forms, and presently all were keenly alert.
The gunner&#8217;s mate had secured his machine
gun to be prepared to rake the enemy with a
withering fire in case of opposition.</p>

<p>The launch turned between two bold headlands
and steered for the dark land. They
were running into a long narrow arm of the
sea&mdash;the Bay of Fangaloa, a mile wide and
three miles deep.</p>

<p>Every eye was strained ahead, gazing for<span class="pagenum" id="Page_317">[317]</span>
the schooner. There were but few lights on
the distant beach. Most of the natives were
long ago in bed.</p>

<p>Quietly the sailors had taken their stations.
Each carried only a revolver; for night use
rifles are less effective. Phil and Sydney
stood side by side ready to lead their men on
board the &#8220;Talofa.&#8221; The darkness was intense.
The bold and densely wooded mountains
rising precipitously above them cast a
deep shadow over the waters of the bay.</p>

<p>A satisfied grunt from Tuamana was the
first news that their quarry had been located.
The chiefs keen eyes had perceived the
ghostly outline of a sail. In a few minutes
all recognized the schooner, lying near the
extreme end of the bay. Her great mainsail
was set and its whiteness against the land had
first revealed her presence.</p>

<p>No one spoke. The steam launch had
been slowed in speed, and all precautions
taken to assure surprise. The fireman ceaselessly
watched his boiler to prevent a sudden
escape of steam and the machinist used oil
freely to prevent the slightest machinery
squeak which might reveal their presence.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_318">[318]</span>In silence, except for the slight churn of
the propeller and the swirl of water thrown
from the bow of the launch in its progress,
O&#8217;Neil steered straight for the black hull now
distinctly outlined scarcely five hundred yards
away. No lights were visible on the schooner&mdash;a
good sign. The crew were either all asleep
or ashore.</p>

<p>The launch, with its engine stopped, swung
alongside. Ready hands made her fast, and
a moment after the deserted decks were held
by the Americans.</p>

<p>&#8220;You look out for the forward hatch,&#8221; Phil
ordered Sydney. &#8220;O&#8217;Neil, take a half dozen
men with Stump, and make sail. Tell the
launch to take a line and tow us out of the
bog.&#8221;</p>

<p>Phil with two sailors moved toward the
cabin ladder. He gazed below into forbidding
blackness.</p>

<p>&#8220;I wonder if Scott is down there?&#8221; he exclaimed.
&#8220;If he is he will soon be up when
he feels his ship under way.&#8221;</p>

<p>Phil heard the sound of the capstan as
O&#8217;Neil and his men began to weigh the anchor.
Then the squeak of gear grinding through<span class="pagenum" id="Page_319">[319]</span>
unoiled blocks gave proof that the foresail
and head-sails were being set. Soon a slight
jar and the louder noise of the churning of the
launch&#8217;s propeller told him the schooner was
under way, and then slowly she moved through
the quiet water of the bay toward the sea.</p>

<p>&#8220;Keep watch here,&#8221; Phil said to his two
men. Then with his revolver in hand he
slowly, cautiously descended the ladder.
Stories told of this pirate Scott came into his
mind. At the bottom the darkness was oppressive.
Phil endeavored to listen for the
breathing of the man he sought, but his own
heart-beats deafened him. He did not know
which way to turn. Where were the sleeping
quarters?</p>

<p>He fumbled in his pockets and drew forth
a box of matches. Then quickly striking one
he held it above his head. He was in a small
cabin containing a table and a few leathered
bunks. A door opened to his right. Advancing
he held the match before him. He saw
the small room was a stateroom, but it was
empty. Captain Scott was not on board the
ship. Disappointedly he mounted the ladder
and turned his steps forward.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_320">[320]</span>Sydney and O&#8217;Neil had aroused the crew,
six men in all, and had employed them hauling
on ropes. Stump was talking with a tall
native as Phil approached.</p>

<p>&#8220;Captain Scott isn&#8217;t in the cabin,&#8221; he informed
his companions; &#8220;but we have his
vessel, anyway.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Did you go down there alone?&#8221; Stump
exclaimed incredulously.</p>

<p>&#8220;I certainly did,&#8221; Phil replied, laughing
half nervously at the evident surprise in
Stump&#8217;s voice, &#8220;and my heart&#8217;s still racing
like that steam launch engine.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Mine would have stopped,&#8221; Stump declared.
&#8220;I&#8217;m glad he ain&#8217;t on board. I never
want to see the old pirate again until I see
him hanged.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;What does his crew say?&#8221; Phil asked.</p>

<p>&#8220;This is Maka,&#8221; Stump said indicating the
tall native. &#8220;Captain Scott, he says, went
ashore to meet Klinger somewhere, he doesn&#8217;t
know where, and left word he&#8217;d sail in the
morning.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, he won&#8217;t.&#8221; Phil chuckled. &#8220;Gee!
I&#8217;d like to see his face when he arrives and
sees no schooner.&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_321">[321]</span>The little steam launch toiled away, dragging
its huge burden toward the sea.</p>

<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s two o&#8217;clock,&#8221; Phil said looking at his
watch by the light of a lantern. &#8220;There will
be little wind before morning, and then it
will probably be offshore. I think we&#8217;d
better have the launch tow us well clear of
the reefs before we attempt to haul aft the
sheets.&#8221;</p>

<p>O&#8217;Neil nodded in agreement.</p>

<p>&#8220;We&#8217;ll have to arrange watches,&#8221; Phil said.
&#8220;I&#8217;m overpowered with sleep myself, and I
suppose we all are in about the same condition.
We&#8217;ve four of us to stand watch. I
insist on standing the first hour, then I&#8217;ll
call you, Syd.&#8221;</p>

<p>O&#8217;Neil protested: &#8220;Excuse me, sir. You
and Mr. Monroe are young and need lots of
sleep. I couldn&#8217;t sleep if I tried. Stump
here sometimes stays awake for days at a time.
It&#8217;s all a matter of habit, this sleeping is.
Now, please, you gentlemen go and turn in,
and I&#8217;ll call you if anything happens that you
ought to know of.&#8221;</p>

<p>Phil was really too sleepy to protest vigorously,
so he and Sydney curled down on<span class="pagenum" id="Page_322">[322]</span>
mattresses, brought up from Scott&#8217;s cabin, and
were soon sound asleep.</p>

<p>When Phil woke the sun was high up and
the &#8220;Talofa&#8221; was under sail. The steam
launch raced along several hundred yards
away. The breeze was light and the water
smooth.</p>

<p>&#8220;There&#8217;s smoke out there on the horizon,&#8221;
O&#8217;Neil said as he came aft, looking as fresh as
if he had slept the whole night through.
&#8220;There ain&#8217;t any steamer expected, is there,
sir?&#8221;</p>

<p>Phil shook his head. &#8220;Not for another
week, anyway,&#8221; he replied excitedly. Then
he gazed toward the land. &#8220;We&#8217;re twenty
miles from shore, at least,&#8221; he added.</p>

<p>&#8220;The wind&#8217;s offshore, but the trade wind
will be stronger out here when it starts up,
and we can then make Ukula in one leg,&#8221;
O&#8217;Neil replied.</p>

<p>Phil considered for several minutes. Was
the smoke a Herzovinian war-ship or was it the
&#8220;Sacramento&#8221;? If it was the latter it would
be of great service to the admiral on board to
know the conditions in Kapua before he was
sighted by the watchful sailors on Mission<span class="pagenum" id="Page_323">[323]</span>
Hill. If it turned out to be the other war-ship
no harm could be done by taking a look
at it.</p>

<p>&#8220;Bear up, O&#8217;Neil, and run down and investigate,&#8221;
Phil said quietly. &#8220;Hail the
launch and tell her to proceed toward Ukula,
but keep outside until we catch up, and watch
us for signals.&#8221;</p>

<p>With the wind free the fast schooner fairly
skimmed over the water, racing toward the
curl of smoke barely distinguishable.</p>

<p>&#8220;Smoke down here means something,&#8221;
O&#8217;Neil said as he returned with Stump after
seeing that all the running gear was properly
belayed and the sails trimmed. Then he
added cheerfully, &#8220;We&#8217;ll be eating breakfast
at the expense of our absent friend Captain
Scott in a few minutes. Stump knows where
he keeps his eatables, and we&#8217;ve got a seaman
with us who can make as good coffee as you
can buy in a first-class &#8216;Frisco&#8217; hotel.&#8221;</p>

<p>It seemed ages to the anxious Americans
before the small speck of a hull appeared
beneath the curl of misty smoke.</p>

<p>&#8220;She&#8217;s painted white,&#8221; O&#8217;Neil exclaimed
as he handed the binoculars to Phil. The<span class="pagenum" id="Page_324">[324]</span>
midshipmen each took a look, then shook
their heads. She was too far away. &#8220;Imagination,
O&#8217;Neil,&#8221; Sydney suggested.</p>

<p>&#8220;Another fifteen minutes and we&#8217;ll know
for sure,&#8221; Sydney said nervously. &#8220;I hope
it&#8217;s the &#8216;Sacramento.&#8217;&#8221;</p>

<p>The steam launch had disappeared, swallowed
up against the background of the high
mountains of the island.</p>

<p>Slowly the speck on the horizon took shape.
Anxiously the Americans watched, each eager
to recognize some outline that would tell them
whether the strange vessel was flying their
flag or that of the power which to all intents
and purposes was their rival, if not enemy.</p>

<p>&#8220;What will you do,&#8221; Sydney asked Phil
excitedly, &#8220;if she&#8217;s not the &#8216;Sacramento&#8217;?&#8221;</p>

<p>Phil glanced aloft at the straining canvas.
The wind had come out at southeast, and on
the sea whitecaps of foam were here and there
appearing. He knew that within the hour
or even less a strong trade wind would be
blowing fair for Ukula harbor.</p>

<p>&#8220;We&#8217;ll try to beat her in,&#8221; he replied, &#8220;and
announce her coming to Commander Tazewell.
But,&#8221; he added hopelessly, &#8220;what can<span class="pagenum" id="Page_325">[325]</span>
he do? We are too weak now to oppose the
count&#8217;s government, and with this re&euml;nforcement
our chances will be hopeless.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s the &#8216;Sacramento,&#8217; all right!&#8221; O&#8217;Neil
exclaimed. &#8220;See those big bow sponsons for
her guns. It&#8217;s all over but the shouting now
for friend Kataafa! He&#8217;ll be doing a foot-race
for his summer capital, and the count will
be taking a voyage in a war-ship for his
health!&#8221;</p>

<p>No doubt longer existed. O&#8217;Neil&#8217;s brisk
summing up of the events of the future
brought a smile of relief to the lips of the
midshipmen. Phil gazed long and earnestly
at the approaching war-ship. She had apparently
altered her course and was now heading
down directly for them.</p>

<p>A few moments later a puff of smoke was
seen ejected from the high forecastle and a
muffled report was heard some dozen seconds
later&mdash;the universal message of the sea, announcing,
&#8220;I desire to communicate.&#8221;</p>

<p>The big war-ship, her decks crowded with
curious sailors, lay motionless in the water as
the schooner &#8220;hove to&#8221; close alongside.</p>

<p>Phil had answered the hail and reported<span class="pagenum" id="Page_326">[326]</span>
he had information of importance for the
admiral.</p>

<p>A boat shot down from the &#8220;Sacramento&#8217;s&#8221;
davits, and was soon alongside the &#8220;Talofa.&#8221;</p>

<p>O&#8217;Neil tended the boat line and good-naturedly
chaffed the inquisitive boat&#8217;s crew.</p>

<p>&#8220;We&#8217;re doing a little buccaneering, that&#8217;s
all,&#8221; he answered an eager inquiry as to their
mission. &#8220;The islanders are fighting between
themselves. You fellows came just at the
right time. Say,&#8221; he added, &#8220;did you see
anything of a Herzovinian war-ship heading
this way, burning up the paint on her
bottom?&#8221;</p>

<p>The coxswain of the whale-boat declared
that the schooner was the only sail they had
sighted since leaving Honolulu, nearly two
weeks ago.</p>

<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s a big ocean, ain&#8217;t it?&#8221; O&#8217;Neil said
thoughtfully.</p>

<p>Phil stepped down into the whale-boat and
was soon being rowed across to the war-ship.
The admiral wished to hear the news directly
and from Phil in person.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER XIX<br />


<small>A RE&Euml;NFORCEMENT</small></h2>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">Rear Admiral Spotts</span>, whose flag was
flown at the masthead of the cruiser &#8220;Sacramento,&#8221;
wasted no time in drawing from Phil
the complete story of everything that had
happened in Kapua.</p>

<p>The captain of the flag-ship and the admiral&#8217;s
flag-lieutenant were both present in
the cabin and followed the lad&#8217;s narrative
with great interest and amazement.</p>

<p>Phil told of the decision by the chief justice
for Panu-Mafili, and then the attack upon
Ukula by Kataafa and his warriors, armed
with guns purchased apparently from the
Kapuan firm, of the appointment of Count
Rosen as governor, and the appeal for annexation
to Herzovinia.</p>

<p>&#8220;I think I can now see,&#8221; the admiral declared,
&#8220;why the Washington government
sent a revenue cutter post-haste from San<span class="pagenum" id="Page_328">[328]</span>
Francisco to Honolulu to order me to proceed
with my flag-ship to Kapua. A great wrong,&#8221;
he added earnestly, &#8220;has been done the treaty,
and my duty is clearly to set it right, by force
if necessary. I shall consider this Count
Rosen an adventurer.</p>

<p>&#8220;Yet,&#8221; he said after a few thoughtful minutes,
&#8220;you say the count is prepared against
my coming. When those of the &#8216;de facto&#8217;
government see our ship approaching, they
are ready to take the responsibility of hoisting
the Herzovinian flag over Kapua. Then I
shall be powerless; only an order from Herzovinia
can remove the badge of annexation.
What we do after that will not be an act
against the government of Kapua. It will be
against the sovereignty of Herzovinia.&#8221;</p>

<p>A plan had suddenly flashed through Phil&#8217;s
mind. The admiral was quick to see the
sudden eagerness in the midshipman&#8217;s face.
A kindly smile spread slowly over his own
grizzled countenance.</p>

<p>&#8220;You have something rash and daring in
mind, I am sure,&#8221; he said, half in amusement,
but half seriously. &#8220;You have the local color
and inspiration of contact. Tell us your plan.&#8221;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_329">[329]</span></p>
<div class="figcenter"><img src="images/i_328.jpg" alt="" /></div>
<p class="caption">&#8220;IS IT QUITE CLEAR?&#8221; THE ADMIRAL ASKED</p>

<p>The humor of the situation suddenly struck
Phil, and he blushed to the roots of his hair.
&#8220;Pardon me, sir, for being so bold,&#8221; he replied
apologetically. &#8220;The same thing must have
also struck you, sir, and that is the &#8216;Sacramento&#8217;
must enter Ukula harbor at night
and secretly and Commander Tazewell must
meanwhile prevent the hoisting of the Herzovinian
flag.&#8221;</p>

<p>All three of his hearers gave an ungrudging
assent. The admiral took out his watch.
&#8220;It&#8217;s now a little after one o&#8217;clock,&#8221; he said.
&#8220;We are thirty odd miles from Ukula. You
can probably be there by dark. I&#8217;ll enter the
harbor at ten o&#8217;clock to-night and shall have
my entire force of three hundred men ashore
within ten minutes after we anchor. Tell
Commander Tazewell I shall leave all details
to him, for he knows the situation better than
I. Tell him my decision is to uphold the law
of the chief justice under the existing treaty
until our government orders me to do otherwise.&#8221;</p>

<p>Phil thrilled with joyful excitement as he
listened to the admiral&#8217;s quiet but decided voice.</p>

<p>&#8220;Is it quite clear?&#8221; the admiral asked.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_330">[330]</span>&#8220;Perfectly, sir,&#8221; Phil assured him.</p>

<p>&#8220;Then I must speed the parting guest.&#8221;
The admiral smiled, and put out his hand.</p>

<p>Phil shook the hand warmly.</p>

<p>&#8220;Happy is he who brings young men to his
council table,&#8221; the admiral quoted.</p>

<p>With Phil on board, the &#8220;Talofa&#8221; lost no
time in squaring away for Ukula. The &#8220;Sacramento&#8221;
was seen to turn and head out to sea,
so as not to be in danger of discovery from
shore. Phil told the plan to his shipmates.</p>

<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s a corker!&#8221; O&#8217;Neil exclaimed gleefully.
&#8220;There&#8217;s just one thing you haven&#8217;t
mentioned,&#8221; he added seriously. &#8220;They&#8217;ll see
the &#8216;Sacramento&#8217; coming in from the pilot
station and maybe from Mission Hill. The
Herzovinian war-ship will also be on the lookout.&#8221;</p>

<p>Phil nodded. &#8220;Yes,&#8221; he said questioningly.</p>

<p>&#8220;Then, sir,&#8221; the sailorman declared, &#8220;we
must prevent those at the pilot station sending
the news, and blind the other two. A
couple of our men can fix the pilot station,
and our search-lights can do the rest. They
can&#8217;t see the cruisers with those big glims in
their eyes.&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_331">[331]</span>&#8220;Fine suggestion, O&#8217;Neil,&#8221; Phil exclaimed.
&#8220;I&#8217;ll certainly give it to the captain. And by
the way, I have a thought,&#8221; he added eagerly,
as the &#8220;Talofa&#8221; raced toward the distant land,
all sails spank full and sheets straining.
&#8220;We&#8217;ll get on board the launch, leaving the
&#8216;Talofa&#8217; outside to come in later after dark.
It will create less curiosity. Stump and a
couple of men can hold her.&#8221; He looked at
Sydney questioningly. &#8220;I reckon, Syd,&#8221; he
said apologetically, &#8220;you&#8217;ll have to miss the
fun on shore and stand by the schooner.&#8221;</p>

<p>Although the midshipman felt somewhat
disappointed he did not show it.</p>

<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s natural,&#8221; he said. &#8220;I&#8217;ll bring her
in after dark, all right, and be in time in case
there&#8217;s a row.&#8221;</p>

<p>They found the steam launch awaiting them
about fifteen miles from the harbor, and
quickly transferred to her all but Sydney,
Stump and two sailors, who remained to sail
the schooner into Ukula.</p>

<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t pile her on the reef,&#8221; Phil cautioned
banteringly, as the steam launch shoved off
from the &#8220;Talofa&#8217;s&#8221; side and headed at full
speed for Ukula.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_332">[332]</span>&#8220;We should be in by five o&#8217;clock,&#8221; Phil said
as he looked at his watch. &#8220;Now,&#8221; he added,
&#8220;these are going to be exciting times, eh,
O&#8217;Neil? I wonder what&#8217;s coming out of it
all?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It looks as if that count was getting cold
feet,&#8221; the boatswain&#8217;s mate replied. &#8220;If he&#8217;d
had more nerve the Herzovinian flag would
have been flying on the flagstaff at Kulinuu
right now.&#8221;</p>

<p>Phil shook his head. &#8220;It&#8217;s a pretty big
undertaking to annex a kingdom unless you
are sure you&#8217;re going to be backed up,&#8221; he
said.</p>

<p>&#8220;It didn&#8217;t take our admiral long to make
up his mind,&#8221; O&#8217;Neil reminded. &#8220;And he
doesn&#8217;t know he&#8217;s going to be backed up,
either.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s different,&#8221; Phil replied. &#8220;He is
only restoring a king to a throne under a law
that he considers yet binding. And he has
sufficient force to do it.&#8221;</p>

<p>Chief Tuamana had shown evident and outward
signs of great joy when Phil told him
that the American admiral was going to uphold
the chief justice&#8217;s decision, and passing a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_333">[333]</span>
big Kapuan canoe filled with natives, the delighted
chief raised his voice to taunt his enemies,
some of whom he recognized, when Phil
by main force drew him down and told him
forcefully to keep his counsel to himself.</p>

<p>&#8220;They&#8217;re just like schoolboys with a secret,
sir,&#8221; O&#8217;Neil said. &#8220;Those natives are on their
way home, aren&#8217;t they?&#8221; he asked of Tuamana.
The launch was not over three miles from the
harbor. The &#8220;Talofa&#8217;s&#8221; sail was barely in
sight on the horizon.</p>

<p>The chief shook his head.</p>

<p>&#8220;Going to Vaileli for a dance,&#8221; he answered
in very broken English. &#8220;Chief
Tuatele is there in that boat; he ask me to go
along. He make fun of me.&#8221; The chief
grunted in contempt.</p>

<p>&#8220;Do you mean there&#8217;s going to be a big
Siva-Siva there to-night?&#8221; Phil asked eagerly.</p>

<p>Tuamana replied in the affirmative. &#8220;This
day big day at Vaileli plantation. Very big
&#8216;Siva-Siva&#8217; and &#8216;Talola.&#8217;&#8221;<a id="FNanchor_38" href="#Footnote_38" class="fnanchor">[38]</a></p>

<p>As they drew nearer the harbor they saw
large numbers of war canoes filled with natives,
all dressed in gala attire, paddling out<span class="pagenum" id="Page_334">[334]</span>
through the break in the reef, confirming
Tuamana&#8217;s information.</p>

<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s a lucky stroke,&#8221; Phil exclaimed.
&#8220;Probably the count and Klinger will both
be at the Vaileli plantation, and if so, there&#8217;ll
be no trouble carrying out the admiral&#8217;s plan.
I&#8217;m going to find out for sure,&#8221; he added as an
extra large canoe holding nearly forty men
and women passed them, its crew shouting
and singing in high glee.</p>

<p>&#8220;Run up close,&#8221; Phil said quietly to O&#8217;Neil.
Then to Tuamana, &#8220;Say nothing of our
plans,&#8221; he cautioned, &#8220;only find out what&#8217;s
actually going to happen.&#8221;</p>

<p>The canoe paddlers stopped their efforts and
waited. Twoscore eager smiling faces were
turned upon the Americans, and from all the
musical greeting of &#8220;Talofa, Alii&#8221; was given.</p>

<p>Tuamana rose and with solemn dignity
spoke to the people in the canoe. He was answered
by an elderly warrior sitting in the
stern of the canoe. Both Tuamana and the
Kataafa warrior addressed maintained a
haughty but dignified bearing toward each
other.</p>

<p>Finally Tuamana nodded, and the old patriarch<span class="pagenum" id="Page_335">[335]</span>
gave a command. The song again
broke forth, and in perfect time the paddles
were dipped and the canoe shot on her way.</p>

<p>&#8220;All Ukula go Vaileli, to-night,&#8221; Tuamana
said, after the launch had again been headed
for the harbor. &#8220;Big &#8216;Talola&#8217; and &#8216;Siva&#8217; to
Missi Klinger.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Fine business!&#8221; O&#8217;Neil exclaimed.
&#8220;They&#8217;ll come back in the morning to find
a new king at Kulinuu.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Kataafa go too,&#8221; the chief added.</p>

<p>Phil could hardly suppress his joy. Things
were certainly coming their way.</p>

<p>As Phil ascended the ladder of the &#8220;Sitka,&#8221;
Commander Tazewell anxiously awaited him.
But before the commander could ask a question,
Phil hurriedly but guardedly outlined
the news, and followed his captain into his
cabin.</p>

<p>&#8220;Schultz has deserted us,&#8221; the captain told
him. &#8220;He got ashore during the night&mdash;probably
let himself down over the side into
a waiting canoe. So you can speak out.&#8221;
Phil had been conversing in guarded tones.</p>

<p>The entire situation from beginning to end
was discussed, the executive officer and most<span class="pagenum" id="Page_336">[336]</span>
of the important officers of the cruiser being
present.</p>

<p>&#8220;The &#8216;Sacramento&#8217; will be here at ten
o&#8217;clock,&#8221; Commander Tazewell said after all
points had been discussed. &#8220;Captain Sturdy
and his British sailors will hold all roads
leading into Ukula west of the Mulivaii River
while we garrison Matautu to that river. A
squad will take care of the pilot station, and
guards must be furnished all the consulates in
Matautu.&#8221;</p>

<p>All listened eagerly. The time all had
looked forward to was fast approaching.</p>

<p>&#8220;Lieutenant Morrison will command our
men,&#8221; the captain added, as he rose to his
feet in sign of dismissal. &#8220;We may of course
have opposition, but we must guard against
precipitating the fighting. Our duty is only
to hold and not to advance. When the admiral
arrives he will of course tell us what to
do next.</p>

<p>&#8220;Tents, rations and supplies will be landed
to-night after the sailors are ashore,&#8221; he added.</p>

<p>Phil remained behind after the officers had
filed out of the cabin, having been detained
by a word from his captain.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_337">[337]</span>&#8220;I want you to take the news to Mr. Lee
at once,&#8221; Commander Tazewell said to the
lad, &#8220;and show him the necessity for secrecy.
No one must know until we are ashore.&#8221;</p>

<p>Phil made himself presentable, and then
was conveyed to the shore by the captain&#8217;s
boat, which on its return carried a letter from
Commander Tazewell, addressed to Commander
Sturdy of the British war-ship, acquainting
him of the change in the situation
and the plan for the night.</p>

<p>Mr. Lee and Judge Lindsay were both
jubilant over the turn of affairs, while Alice
fairly danced with joy. Miss Lee, quiet and
dignified, rather shrank from the thought of
possible bloodshed. There was only one drop
of bitterness in Alice&#8217;s joy. Phil insisted that
Avao should not be told until after the &#8220;Sacramento&#8221;
had entered the harbor, and landed
her men. He feared the fatal custom of
women&#8217;s gossip among the Kapuans.</p>

<p>&#8220;I sincerely hope this strong stand of our
admiral will have the required effect, and that
we shall have no further bloodshed,&#8221; Mr. Lee
said solemnly.</p>

<p>&#8220;There can be no lasting peace in Kapua,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_338">[338]</span>
Lee,&#8221; the judge exclaimed earnestly, &#8220;so long
as the islands are administered by three rapacious
beasts and animals of prey. A lion
and two eagles can never act in harmony.
It is best for the people that only one
should govern. Herzovinia has the greatest
interests on this island; she should govern it.
Our presence is but a stick in the molasses.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I agree with you in principle, judge,&#8221; Mr.
Lee replied, &#8220;but even you are not willing
to see one nation, in deliberate disregard of
the treaty rights of others, seize what is not
hers.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;That, my dear sir, is not a matter of
politics, but of morals,&#8221; the judge answered.
&#8220;Let us decide the justice of the situation;
but after that is determined then I am anxious
to see this triple government at an end.&#8221;</p>

<p>When Phil left the consulate the two
officials were yet deep in their discussion.
As he hurried toward the landing he noted
that the town was almost deserted of the usual
crowd that gathered along the main thoroughfare
at this time of the early evening. The
&#8220;Talola&#8221; at Vaileli was going to be popular.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_339">[339]</span>As Phil&#8217;s boat rounded to alongside of the
gangway, the &#8220;Talofa&#8221; had just anchored
within a few cables&#8217; length of the &#8220;Sitka.&#8221;</p>

<p>Preparations were being carried forward
with great expedition on board both the
American and British war-ships, but everything
was being done so quietly that no suspicion
had so far been aroused on board the
other cruiser anchored only a short distance
away from each of the allies.</p>

<p>As the ship&#8217;s bell sounded two strokes
(nine o&#8217;clock) a long line of boats filled with
armed sailors shoved off from the two ships
and were towed by steam launches swiftly
toward the shore. Phil and Sydney accompanied
Commander Tazewell in their towing
steam launch. The &#8220;Talofa&#8221; had been
turned over to a squad of sailormen under
a petty officer, to prevent the native crew
from attempting to take her out of the harbor.</p>

<p>Phil&#8217;s eyes were upon the dark outlines of
the Herzovinian war-ship as they passed close
alongside of her. There was a grim smile of
satisfaction in Commander Tazewell&#8217;s face as
he heard loud voices raised in the guttural
Herzovinian tongue, apparently the officer<span class="pagenum" id="Page_340">[340]</span>
of the watch berating the men on lookout for
their slackness. Then came a hurrying of
footsteps upon the deck and finally a hail in
broken English.</p>

<p>&#8220;Is there trouble on shore?&#8221; the voice
called hesitatingly.</p>

<p>Commander Tazewell waited several seconds
before replying.</p>

<p>Once more the voice was raised, this time
more loudly. He had apparently just discovered
a second line of boats on the other
side of his ship, ladened deeply in the water
with sailormen.</p>

<p>&#8220;Has there been a fight on shore? Why
are you landing your men?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Just a precautionary measure,&#8221; Commander
Tazewell&#8217;s clear-cut voice answered.
&#8220;Is your captain on board?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No, sir,&#8221; came back the answer. &#8220;He
has gone to Vaileli.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s no matter,&#8221; Commander Tazewell
replied. &#8220;When he returns I will explain
everything to him.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Thank you, sir,&#8221; said the voice, but it
was plainly noted that the speaker was
greatly perplexed.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_341">[341]</span>&#8220;Only a young officer left on board,&#8221; Commander
Tazewell said quietly to the midshipmen,
&#8220;and taken off his guard, he doesn&#8217;t
know what to do.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;What could he do?&#8221; Phil asked excitedly.</p>

<p>Commander Tazewell shook his head
doubtfully. &#8220;He might land his men too,
but that could not defeat our purpose. With
the English and American sailors in military
control of Ukula, it would take a stronger
man than Count Rosen to annex the islands.&#8221;</p>

<p>The boats glided alongside the wharf at the
foot of the Siumu road and the sailors, their
accouterments rattling musically, scrambled
upon the dock and quickly formed their companies.
But few commands were given.
Each officer knew his station already.</p>

<p>The English commander, fairly beaming
with joy, joined Commander Tazewell on the
dock.</p>

<p>&#8220;I say, that admiral of yours is a jolly
good sport, and we&#8217;re behind him with every
man and gun,&#8221; he exclaimed effusively,
&#8220;and we&#8217;re not much beforehand, either,&#8221;
he added. &#8220;The natives all say that the
Vaileli &#8216;Talola&#8217; was arranged by Count<span class="pagenum" id="Page_342">[342]</span>
Rosen in order to inform Kataafa and his
warriors that the islands will be annexed as
soon as their war-ship, hourly expected, arrives.
It&#8217;s a sort of informal annexation, don&#8217;t
you know. And they&#8217;ll come back and then,
as you Americans say, they&#8217;ll &#8216;wake up.&#8217;&#8221;</p>

<p>Commander Tazewell joined in the laugh.
The dock was clear. All the men landed
had gone to their stations, and their boats
had been towed back to their ships to be
filled with tentage and provisions.</p>

<p>&#8220;By now,&#8221; he said grimly, &#8220;there probably
are many eager messengers hurrying to acquaint
those at Vaileli of what is happening
on the beach of Ukula.&#8221;</p>

<p>Phil was suddenly aware of Avao&#8217;s presence
at his elbow.</p>

<p>&#8220;Kataafa&#8217;s men all take guns,&#8221; she whispered
guardedly. &#8220;Mary Hamilton, she go
too to Vaileli. What are sailors going to do?&#8221;
she asked excitedly.</p>

<p>&#8220;You&#8217;ll see to-morrow, Avao,&#8221; Phil replied
evasively.</p>

<p>&#8220;Too few men,&#8221; Avao persisted anxiously.
&#8220;Kataafa many thousand.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;What does she say?&#8221; Commander Tazewell<span class="pagenum" id="Page_343">[343]</span>
asked, suddenly noting the eagerness in
the girl&#8217;s manner.</p>

<p>Avao repeated what she had told Phil.</p>

<p>&#8220;We&#8217;ll have about three hundred more
inside a half hour, Avao,&#8221; Commander Tazewell
assured her. &#8220;Don&#8217;t you think we can
stand off an attack with those?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Fa&#8217;a moli-moli,&#8221;<a id="FNanchor_39" href="#Footnote_39" class="fnanchor">[39]</a> she said humbly; &#8220;but,
Alii, I know my people, and I afraid bad men
may tell them fight. Suppose I go to the
count and say do not permit armed natives to
come to-night back to Ukula. If they come
maybe have big fight.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;There seems to be something in what the
girl says, Tazewell,&#8221; Commander Sturdy exclaimed.
&#8220;Of course our plan is to refuse
them entrance, and open fire if they persist.
Yet we&#8217;d like to prevent a fight if we can win
without it.&#8221;</p>

<p>Commander Tazewell remained silently
thoughtful for several minutes. To him the
plan savored too much of asking the count
a favor. However, it was in the cause of
humanity. If word was to be sent the girl
could not take it alone. An officer from<span class="pagenum" id="Page_344">[344]</span>
his command must go. He turned his eyes
toward the midshipmen, standing silently
awaiting the decision.</p>

<p>&#8220;Perry, will you go to the count at Vaileli
plantation?&#8221; he said quietly. &#8220;Explain the
situation and see if he will agree to prevent
bloodshed. To-morrow we can treat with him.
Monroe,&#8221; he added hurriedly, &#8220;please take
my gig and tell the executive officer of the
&#8216;Sitka&#8217; about using the search-lights beginning
at fifteen minutes of ten.&#8221;</p>

<p>Sydney saluted, gulped down his disappointment
and turned toward the waiting
boat. He had been on the point of asking
to go with Phil.</p>

<p>&#8220;You and Avao can get mounts at the
consulate,&#8221; Commander Tazewell continued,
turning to Phil, who stood like a sprinter
ready to run or a hunting dog about to be
unleashed.</p>

<small>THE TABLES TURNED</small></h2>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">Alice</span> helped Phil and Avao saddle two of
her father&#8217;s ponies.</p>

<p>Time was too precious for conversation, and
Phil spoke only in monosyllables, much to
Alice&#8217;s disgust.</p>

<p>&#8220;We are going to the plantation house at
Vaileli,&#8221; he had told her, &#8220;but just what we
expect to accomplish I don&#8217;t exactly know.&#8221;</p>

<p>As he gave a last tug at the girth bands of
the two animals, and lifted Avao on to her
side-saddle, he looked about for Alice, but she
had disappeared into the darkness of the
stable.</p>

<p>&#8220;Come on, Avao,&#8221; he exclaimed eagerly;
&#8220;we&#8217;ve got to do the entire distance on a run
if our ponies can stand it.&#8221; He shook loose
his reins after leaping into the saddle and
dug his heels into the pony&#8217;s flanks. The
pony, believing it meant a race, sprang smartly
forward with an eager whinny of delight, and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_346">[346]</span>
away he raced through the gate of the consulate.
Avao followed only a few lengths
behind.</p>

<p>They had gone several miles at a rapid
pace, when it became evident that a third
horseman was following.</p>

<p>Phil was greatly disturbed when Alice,
mounted on her father&#8217;s Australian horse,
a larger and much sturdier breed than the
native pony, drew up beside them.</p>

<p>&#8220;I have learned enough not to ask permission
when I want to go with you,&#8221; she
exclaimed between breaths. &#8220;Now, don&#8217;t be
angry. I&#8217;m in no danger from the natives.&#8221;</p>

<p>They found the road deserted. The villages
through which they passed at breakneck speed
were dark and empty.</p>

<p>&#8220;Look,&#8221; Avao exclaimed. &#8220;Vaileli!&#8221;</p>

<p>A bright light, apparently caused by a huge
fire, had sprung into view not far distant. As
they raced forward they now passed on the
road natives, singly and in twos and threes,
hurrying toward the scene of festivity.</p>

<p>At the massive stone gateway leading into
the plantation, the three drew rein and allowed
their gasping ponies to walk.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_347">[347]</span>As they drew nearer they saw that many
fires had been kindled. The great space in
front of the plantation house was flooded with
light, about which hundreds of men and
women had gathered. All were in gala attire.
Each of the warriors carried his precious gun,
with his cartridge belt of webbed material
worn jauntily over his naked shoulder.</p>

<p>&#8220;Where shall I find the count?&#8221; Phil
asked.</p>

<p>Avao fearlessly greeted the people, who
gazed in amazement at the intruders. She
called many by name and they, like children,
soon forgetting their grievance, smiled back
and bade her welcome.</p>

<p>&#8220;The count is at the house, they say,&#8221; the
girl answered Phil&#8217;s question.</p>

<p>&#8220;You and Avao remain mounted,&#8221; Phil
said, as they approached the low bungalow of
the plantation, used as a residence for the
manager and his white overseers. He noted
that the wide porch was crowded with people
dressed in white, and as he got closer he
recognized the count&#8217;s strong figure with the
high chief Kataafa standing beside him.</p>

<p>The great delicacy of his mission suddenly<span class="pagenum" id="Page_348">[348]</span>
flashed upon him. Here were gathered nearly
five thousand warriors, all armed with modern
rifles. The power represented was in the
hands of the two men before him. They
could by one word hurl the entire assemblage
upon the sailors now ashore in Ukula. Then
another face appeared in the crowd, the sphynx-like
countenance of &#8220;Bully&#8221; Scott, the man
whose schooner Phil had taken. Did he
know!</p>

<p>Throwing his horse&#8217;s reins to Avao, Phil
slipped from his saddle and advanced up the
steps of the porch. The count received him
with but scant courtesy. No attempt was
made to hide his displeasure. Phil knew that
all eyes were upon him, and felt their hostile
stare. It was a situation calculated to disconcert
the boldest. Phil steeled himself to
hide his great nervousness.</p>

<p>&#8220;I come from my captain.&#8221; He heard his
own voice as if from a long way off. There
was an ominous silence all about him. &#8220;My
message is for your ear alone, Count Rosen,&#8221;
he said.</p>

<p>A deep frown of annoyance furrowed the
count&#8217;s brow.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_349">[349]</span>&#8220;Isn&#8217;t this time inopportune?&#8221; he exclaimed
angrily.</p>

<p>Phil appreciated that every moment was
valuable. The news of the landing of the
sailors was on the way. The runners that
they had passed on the road were probably
bringing the unwelcome tidings.</p>

<p>&#8220;It is of the highest importance,&#8221; the lad
replied tensely. &#8220;Otherwise you must know
that my captain would not have sent me at
this time.&#8221;</p>

<p>Phil noted a suspicion of alarm in the
count&#8217;s face. Suddenly a buzz of excitement
disturbed the quiet, and Phil, glancing about
quickly, following people&#8217;s gaze, saw the
flash of search-lights from the direction of
Ukula.</p>

<p>&#8220;That is what I have come to explain,&#8221;
Phil added, gaining confidence. The &#8220;Sacramento&#8221;
was entering the harbor. In a few
minutes, the admiral had said, three hundred
sailors would be on shore to re&euml;nforce Commander
Tazewell&#8217;s men.</p>

<p>The count without other than a sign to follow
him turned and entered the house.</p>

<p>In a room giving off from the hall, and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_350">[350]</span>
lighted only by a single oil lamp, he stopped
and motioned Phil to speak.</p>

<p>&#8220;An American admiral has arrived, and
all the American and English sailors and
marines are now holding Ukula. Commander
Tazewell begs that you will use your
good offices to prevent useless bloodshed.
Your warriors must not attempt to return
to-night. To-morrow the admiral will hold
council, and invites you to come to arrange a
peaceful settlement. That is all, sir,&#8221; Phil
added finally.</p>

<p>The count&#8217;s face was livid, while the hand
that pulled his long moustache shook like an
aspen. Words for once failed him. He knew
that he had played and lost.</p>

<p>Footsteps from the hall heralded the approach
of others. Phil&#8217;s heart sank. Had
the news of the landing of the sailors already
come? Klinger and Scott had entered the
room. Phil gazed at them, but saw only displeasure
in their faces. The greeting he had
been about to give was withheld.</p>

<p>Finally the count spoke. His voice was
husky. The blow had been severe.</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll do what I can. Now go!&#8221; He half<span class="pagenum" id="Page_351">[351]</span>
shoved Phil out of the room. &#8220;No earthly
power can save you if you are not away before
that savage horde out there has learned this
insult to their king.&#8221;</p>

<p>Phil half stumbled down the steps and
flung himself into the saddle.</p>

<p>&#8220;Ride fast, Avao,&#8221; he ordered sharply,
&#8220;straight for the gate, and, Alice, you follow
her. Go on, faster, faster.&#8221; He herded them
before him.</p>

<p>The natives in their path quickly got out
of their way and called after them &#8220;Faimalosi,&#8221;<a id="FNanchor_40" href="#Footnote_40" class="fnanchor">[40]</a>
thinking that they were only enjoying
a pony race.</p>

<p>Before they had reached the gate of the
plantation the news of the landing of the
sailors had arrived.</p>

<p>&#8220;They have heard from Ukula,&#8221; Alice
called from over her shoulder, indicating a
group of armed natives squatting by the side
of the road feasting upon fruit stripped from
trees in their near vicinity, &#8220;and are wondering
what it means.&#8221; Even as she spoke to
Phil, one of the group called out questioningly
to Avao. The native girl tossed back an answer<span class="pagenum" id="Page_352">[352]</span>
and her words apparently were satisfactory
and caused a laugh.</p>

<p>Phil heaved a sigh of relief as they swung
through the gate. By mutual consent their
horses were slowed to a trot, and the three
drew close together to converse.</p>

<p>&#8220;What did the count say?&#8221; Alice questioned
eagerly.</p>

<p>&#8220;He promised he&#8217;d do what he could,&#8221;
Phil replied, his voice unsteady from the recent
excitement. &#8220;I&#8217;m afraid the &#8216;Frankenstein&#8217;
he has created has grown beyond his
control. We&#8217;re bound to have war.&#8221;</p>

<p>When Phil and his companions arrived in
Ukula the town resembled an armed camp.
The roads leading to the village were all
strongly held. Machine guns and field pieces
had been mounted behind hastily constructed
barricades. The main strength of the forces
was encamped in the town proper between
the two streams. The British sailors were in
garrison at Kulinuu. The cruiser &#8220;Sacramento&#8221;
had anchored in a commanding position
with her heavy broadside bearing upon
the town.</p>

<p>Phil found Commander Tazewell and the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_353">[353]</span>
admiral at the Tivoli Hotel, where the latter
had taken up his headquarters, and gave
them an account of his mission.</p>

<p>&#8220;We must not relax vigilance,&#8221; Admiral
Spotts said, while Phil saluted, ready to withdraw.
&#8220;I believe that no hostilities will be
thought of until to-morrow. Then we shall
see what can be done through diplomacy to
avoid bloodshed.&#8221;</p>

<p>Phil and Sydney occupied that night their
old room in the consulate.</p>

<p>&#8220;When I got on board and gave the executive
officer the captain&#8217;s message about the
search-lights,&#8221; Sydney said, after Phil had
graphically told of the trip to Vaileli and of
the great gathering of armed warriors, &#8220;he
looked queerly at me and exclaimed, &#8216;Why,
he told me that himself the last minute before
leaving the ship.&#8217; So, you see, the captain
must have thought there was danger, and
didn&#8217;t want to risk us both.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It would be a terrible loss,&#8221; Phil exclaimed
laughingly.</p>

<p>The next morning Count Rosen and
Klinger rode through town back to their
homes in the Matafeli district.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_354">[354]</span>At ten o&#8217;clock the American admiral and
his officers, in full dress uniform and accompanied
by the American and English consuls
and Judge Lindsay, proceeded to Kulinuu.
About a thousand loyal natives had collected;
all were unarmed. A large bright Kapuan
flag had been brought ashore from the
&#8220;Sitka&#8221; and O&#8217;Neil had bent it on to the
halliards of the tall flagstaff.</p>

<p>When all was ready, the band struck up a
stirring march and the lawful king, Panu-Mafili,
declared eligible by the chief justice,
put in an appearance. He was strongly escorted
by sailors from both the English and
American war-ships.</p>

<p>To Phil the ceremony was very impressive.
The day was beautiful and clear; a gentle
breeze ruffled the deep green waters of the
bay, and stirred lazily the tall cocoanut palms
overhead. The loyal natives, supporters of
Panu, in all their gorgeous coloring, and led
by Tuamana, rose to their feet and sang their
savage song of welcome to their king Malea-Toa
Panu-Mafili.</p>

<p>The chief justice conducted the ceremony.
He first read his decision. Then he gave the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_355">[355]</span>
oath to Panu. As the judge finished he raised
his hand and the song to their king floated
out upon the balmy air: &#8220;Panu o Tupu-e-Kapua.&#8221;
O&#8217;Neil and Marley hauled away on
the halliards, and as the great white, red and
blue flag appeared above the tops of the cocoanut
trees, the three war-ships boomed forth a
national salute in its honor. The Herzovinian
war-ship alone remained sullenly silent.</p>

<p>Panu-Mafili was now the rightful king.
Five miles away at Vaileli, Kataafa and his
five thousand warriors were camped. Panu
could muster barely a thousand men, and
hardly a hundred guns.</p>

<p>&#8220;We have him on the throne,&#8221; Phil heard
the admiral exclaim as each officer beginning
with the American naval commander-in-chief
pressed forward to congratulate the young
king. &#8220;But we&#8217;ve got to hold him on with
our bayonets.&#8221;</p>

<p>At noon the British war-ship was under
way, and standing out of the harbor. Commander
Tazewell, the midshipmen and Alice
watched her go from the consulate porch.</p>

<p>&#8220;Where&#8217;s she going?&#8221; Alice asked in great
surprise, for not an hour ago the war-ship&#8217;s<span class="pagenum" id="Page_356">[356]</span>
captain, Commander Sturdy, had been present
at the coronation of the new king.</p>

<p>&#8220;She&#8217;s going to the island of Kulila,&#8221; Commander
Tazewell told his hearers guardedly,
for there were many natives on the lawn in
front of the house and within ear-shot. &#8220;The
island, you know, is about sixty miles to windward<a id="FNanchor_41" href="#Footnote_41" class="fnanchor">[41]</a>
and the inhabitants are almost entirely
loyal to the Malea-Toa family, of which Panu
is the acknowledged head. Commander
Sturdy has agreed to bring a shipload of
natives and arm them from his own stock of
guns. That will give us at least five hundred
re&euml;nforcements.&#8221;</p>

<p>The allies at once began to prepare their
forces for serious work. Companies of the
loyal natives were being mustered in with
English and American sailormen to lead
them, while white officers were designated to
command the combinations made by joining
several companies. In all, a force of eight
native companies of a hundred men each,
armed with American and English rifles,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_357">[357]</span>
was encamped in the Malae under the command
of Lieutenant Tupper of the British
cruiser; while encamped along the main
street of Ukula five hundred English and
American sailors were ready in addition to
aid in repelling an attack by the old fox
Kataafa, who had been himself now declared
a rebel by Admiral Spotts.</p>

<p>The count and Klinger did not long remain
in Ukula. That afternoon they departed
quietly to Vaileli plantation.</p>

<p>During the afternoon Phil and Sydney rode
with Commander Tazewell along the Siumu
road. All three were armed with revolvers,
but no sailors or natives were taken along.</p>

<p>&#8220;Kataafa has written the admiral the most
remarkable letter,&#8221; the captain said after they
had left behind the last vestige of civilization.
&#8220;He says that he does not question the right
of Panu-Mafili to be king, but that by the
Kapuan custom he also is king, and that according
to their traditional custom, as old as
their race, he will fight Panu for the office.
He says that he has no war with the white
men, and that no harm will come to them if
they do not attack him.&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_358">[358]</span>&#8220;What answer did the admiral send back?&#8221;
Phil and Sydney asked in a breath.</p>

<p>&#8220;That Panu-Mafili was now under the
protection of the two allied powers, and that
if Kataafa attacked him the admiral would
consider it an attack upon his own men, and
that by so doing Kataafa would have brought
on a war with the white men.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Hello,&#8221; Sydney exclaimed suddenly reining
in his horse. A party of natives, their
faces blackened, had silently come from the
bush and barred their way. A chief stepped
forward and courteously told Commander
Tazewell that no one should pass.</p>

<p>While they consulted with the native,
many warriors appeared from each side of
the road and gazed in friendly curiosity at
their visitors.</p>

<p>&#8220;He says,&#8221; Commander Tazewell told the
midshipmen, &#8220;that Kataafa&#8217;s troops have
surrounded the village of Ukula, and will
starve out the inhabitants instead of attacking.
That Kataafa has given orders that
white men shall not be molested, but must
remain within the besieging lines.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Starve them out!&#8221; Phil exclaimed.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_359">[359]</span>
&#8220;Why, that&#8217;s impossible. They can catch
fish and eat fruit.&#8221; The Americans had
withdrawn some yards from the natives, but
remained to observe further.</p>

<p>&#8220;How long do you suppose the supply of
fruit would last?&#8221; Commander Tazewell asked.
&#8220;Besides, many of the fruit trees in Ukula
have been destroyed, and it will take a year
for them to again bear fruit. And as for fish,
the reefs off Ukula are not good fishing ground,
and would not feed one-tenth of the population
now gathered in the vicinity of the town.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Then what are we going to do?&#8221; Phil
asked earnestly.</p>

<p>&#8220;The war-ships will have to give the natives
food from their own supplies,&#8221; the commander
replied. &#8220;Kataafa is a wily old fox,
or else that Herzovinian count is ably advising
him. But come,&#8221; he added, swinging his pony
about; &#8220;we have received interesting news,
and if we are to succeed in this affair, we&#8217;ve
got to take the offensive. The food supplies
on our ships would be devoured by the horde
of natives in the town inside of a week. We
shall have to attack Kataafa in order to feed
our native allies.&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_360">[360]</span>Sydney had been examining the locality
where the greater number of natives had
shown themselves in their curiosity to see the
white men. A gleam of white caught his eye,
and before the warriors that had barred the
passage of the horsemen could interfere, he had
urged his horse ahead a few score of yards.
An agile native grasped firmly the horse&#8217;s
bridle and turned Sydney back toward his
companions, but not until he had solved the
mystery of that gleam of white.</p>

<p>&#8220;Captain &#8216;Bully&#8217; Scott was with that outfit,&#8221;
Sydney exclaimed as they trotted swiftly
toward home. &#8220;I distinctly saw him, hidden
behind a barricade of earth and banana trees;
he was in white clothes, and I saw him distinctly,
gray whiskers and all.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It isn&#8217;t likely he will remain idle,&#8221; Commander
Tazewell replied, not at all surprised
at Sydney&#8217;s news. &#8220;He cannot have any great
friendship for us after we have confiscated his
schooner, and he knows if he is caught by
either an American or an English war-ship
he will have to serve a term in jail for his
many crimes.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s a pity he wasn&#8217;t on board the &#8216;Talofa&#8217;<span class="pagenum" id="Page_361">[361]</span>
when we captured her,&#8221; Phil said. &#8220;Now if
his character is as black as Stump paints it, he
will give us lots of trouble.&#8221;</p>

<p>Commander Tazewell nodded his head
gravely.</p>

<p>&#8220;If the count, Klinger and Scott could be
disposed of we would find these fine fellows
of Kapuans only too willing to bury the
hatchet,&#8221; he exclaimed, &#8220;but those three men
are like vinegar in the molasses barrel. If
blood is shed it will be upon their heads.&#8221;</p>

<small>A RECONNAISSANCE</small></h2>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">A Herzovinian</span> war-ship had come to join
the four other men-of-war, all anchored inside
the narrow harbor of Ukula.</p>

<p>The Herzovinian consul at once went on
board the newcomer, and afterward he and her
captain passed through the allied lines on their
way to Vaileli.</p>

<p>That evening many were the rumors in
Ukula. Alice and Avao collected the stories
from the women.</p>

<p>&#8220;Herzovinia has accepted Kataafa&#8217;s allegiance,
and will aid him to conquer and then
annex the islands,&#8221; Alice told the midshipmen
that evening, &#8220;and also,&#8221; she exclaimed, &#8220;the
women say that Kataafa has been persuaded
to make a big attack on the town.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I can hardly believe it,&#8221; Phil declared,
&#8220;but apparently the admiral is not willing for
us to remain passive in our defense. Have<span class="pagenum" id="Page_363">[363]</span>
you heard,&#8221; he asked, &#8220;about the expedition
to-morrow?&#8221;</p>

<p>Alice shook her head, her eyes big with
excitement. &#8220;Where?&#8221; she asked.</p>

<p>&#8220;No one knows,&#8221; Phil answered. &#8220;We
start at daylight.&#8221;</p>

<p>The next morning before dawn a force of
one hundred sailors, consisting of both English
and Americans, had been formed in column
of march on the Ukula road. A machine gun,
mounted on a light carriage and hauled by
hand, formed a part of the expedition. The
midshipmen were detailed to go along as aides
to the commanding officer, Lieutenant Tupper.</p>

<p>&#8220;We&#8217;re going to reconnoiter Vaileli plantation,
I hear,&#8221; Sydney said as he and Phil
drank their coffee preparatory to joining the
expedition, &#8220;and gather food for the natives
in the town.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Mind, sir, it&#8217;s a ticklish business we&#8217;re
starting out on,&#8221; O&#8217;Neil said confidentially to
the lads as they joined him. The boatswain&#8217;s
mate commanded one of the new companies
of native troops, but had volunteered to go
along, after learning that no native troops were
to take part in the expedition. &#8220;If we do this<span class="pagenum" id="Page_364">[364]</span>
at all we should take all the force we&#8217;ve got
and fall upon them good and hard. Half
measures, sir, are dangerous.&#8221;</p>

<p>The column started just as the first streaks
of dawn appeared in the eastern sky. They
traveled by the road which followed close to
the beach. On one side was the sea and the
other the impenetrable bush. Out beyond the
reef the &#8220;Sitka&#8221; steamed slowly along to
guard them in case of an attack by a force beyond
their strength to oppose.</p>

<p>The expedition reached the Vaileli plantation
by eight o&#8217;clock and halted on the same
ground where only a few nights before the
Kataafa warriors had held their celebrations.
No warriors so far had been encountered. The
only outward evidence of hostilities were the
empty villages passed en route.</p>

<p>A number of cleverly built forts and barricades
along the road had been encountered
and destroyed by the sailors en route.</p>

<p>&#8220;They&#8217;ve all been occupied recently,&#8221; Lieutenant
Tupper declared, &#8220;and they are not of
native design. Some white man&#8217;s hand has
guided them in their construction, that is
evident.&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_365">[365]</span>The &#8220;Sitka&#8221; had entered between the reefs
and dropped anchor in deep water within a
half mile of the shore.</p>

<p>Lieutenant Tupper with several officers, and
among them the midshipmen, approached the
plantation house. They saw many black
boys, Solomon Islanders, working about the
place, but not a white man or a Kapuan was
visible.</p>

<p>Klinger finally appeared. Phil saw that he
was pale and looked worried.</p>

<p>&#8220;Where are the Kataafa men?&#8221; the lieutenant
asked brusquely. &#8220;I see you&#8217;ve been
feeding and sheltering them,&#8221; he added insinuatingly,
&#8220;and doubtless are now concealing
their whereabouts.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I do not know,&#8221; Klinger replied stubbornly.
&#8220;I cannot help it if they take my
fruit. I have no sailors to protect my
property.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ve a good mind to take you back with
us,&#8221; the lieutenant said angrily. &#8220;You and
that count are advising these natives to fight
us. Who else is in the house?&#8221; Tupper asked,
advancing upon the porch.</p>

<p>Klinger held his ground.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_366">[366]</span>&#8220;There are no others here,&#8221; he replied.
&#8220;You are welcome to search the house if you
desire, but I warn you this is Herzovinian
property, and you must answer for all insults.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;d like to see you strung to a yard-arm,&#8221;
Lieutenant Tupper exclaimed, angrier than
ever at the man&#8217;s cool effrontery.</p>

<p>Phil surprised a sinister gleam in Klinger&#8217;s
eyes that gave him a sudden pang of uneasiness.
Did Klinger know where Kataafa and
his warriors were hiding?</p>

<p>&#8220;We are going to requisition your fruit,&#8221;
the lieutenant said authoritatively. &#8220;You can
put in your claim for damages, and if I have
anything to say in the matter you wouldn&#8217;t
get a shilling.&#8221;</p>

<p>The sailors had spread out through the
beautiful groves of banana and breadfruit
trees and were quickly stripping the trees of
their fruit and carrying the great bunches
down to the beach, where they were being
loaded into the cutters of the war-ship.</p>

<p>&#8220;There won&#8217;t be enough to feed a locust on
when they get through,&#8221; O&#8217;Neil chuckled.
&#8220;I&#8217;d like to get a hold on that fellow Klinger
alone for about ten minutes. I have an idea<span class="pagenum" id="Page_367">[367]</span>
he knows where Kataafa and his men are this
very minute.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;We&#8217;re not looking for a fight,&#8221; Sydney
said, shaking his head emphatically. &#8220;We&#8217;re
only making a reconnaissance and bringing
back food for the town. That&#8217;s why no natives
were brought along.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t like the looks of it,&#8221; O&#8217;Neil declared.
&#8220;We sent word to Kataafa that unless
he attacked we would not disturb him for the
present, and he is said to have said the same
thing to us. In that case what is he hiding
for?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Maybe he fears either we or he cannot
keep their word,&#8221; Phil suggested.</p>

<p>O&#8217;Neil shook his head.</p>

<p>&#8220;Look out for a trick,&#8221; the sailor insisted,
&#8220;and besides, I hear Chief Tuatele commands
the natives in the Vaileli district, and he is
the meanest Kapuan ever born. In fact, they
say he has a mixture of Solomon Islander in
him.&#8221;</p>

<p>Lieutenant Morrison and Ensign Patterson
from the &#8220;Sitka&#8221; had listened to the sailor&#8217;s
remarks, and nodded their heads in agreement
with his views.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_368">[368]</span>&#8220;It&#8217;s queer we have met no women,&#8221; Lieutenant
Morrison said in his quiet, thoughtful
voice, &#8220;but of course we go back by the beach
road the way we came, and with the guns of
the &#8216;Sitka&#8217; to back us, I can&#8217;t believe that
even Chief Tuatele would dare attack.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Let him attack,&#8221; Patterson exclaimed.
&#8220;We&#8217;ve got a hundred rifles and a machine
gun. I guess he won&#8217;t find us such an awfully
easy mark.&#8221;</p>

<p>The last boat load of fruit had been sent off
to the &#8220;Sitka&#8221; when the English lieutenant
in command of the expedition formed his
column for the return march.</p>

<p>&#8220;The king of France marched up the hill
and then marched down again,&#8221; he laughed
as he gave the command to set the column in
motion.</p>

<p>Lieutenant Tupper was in the lead. The
road stretched along the seashore, winding
in and out in conforming to the irregularities
of the beach.</p>

<p>&#8220;I say,&#8221; Lieutenant Tupper suddenly exclaimed,
&#8220;isn&#8217;t that road to the left a short
cut?&#8221; He took out a small pocket chart and
consulted it. Then he glanced out to the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_369">[369]</span>
&#8220;Sitka,&#8221; which had gotten under way and
was following, as before, just beyond the surf
on the outer reef. &#8220;It will save us nearly a
mile, and is shady, all the way, through cocoanut
groves.&#8221;</p>

<p>His mind was made up without more ado,
and the head of the column wheeled to the
left away from the sea and their supporting
war-ship and took the trail leading through
the woods.</p>

<p>&#8220;Anybody got any wire cutters?&#8221; O&#8217;Neil
asked Phil, who was walking at his side.
&#8220;Look, sir, both sides barbed wire. Nasty
thing to get through in a hurry.&#8221;</p>

<p>Phil saw that on each side of the road ran
a substantially built fence of barbed wire as
high as a man&#8217;s head. The woods here were
not very thick. Cocoanut and other trees
were plentifully mixed.</p>

<p>They had now reached the top of a rise.
The road from there led down and at the
bottom a small, swift stream would have to
be forded.</p>

<p>The machine gun was being dragged by its
crew between the two companies of sailors.
As the head of the column entered the stream<span class="pagenum" id="Page_370">[370]</span>
it was found that the water was deeper than
where it had been crossed nearer its mouth.
Phil and Sydney were told to warn the machine
gun&#8217;s crew, and have the rear company
give aid if they needed it to get the gun
across safely.</p>

<p>The midshipmen left the head of the column
just as it was on the point of entering the
mountain stream. Phil looked behind as they
ran rapidly back toward the machine gun.</p>

<p>&#8220;The water&#8217;s above the men&#8217;s waists,&#8221; he
exclaimed.</p>

<p>Lieutenant Morrison was waiting at the
machine gun when Phil arrived to tell him
of the depth of the stream which they were
about to cross.</p>

<p>&#8220;Childers,&#8221; the lieutenant said quietly to
the gunner&#8217;s mate in charge of the delicate
weapon, &#8220;better dismount the gun and have
it carried across by hand. We cannot afford
to run the risk of getting the mechanism wet.&#8221;
He looked about him and Phil read apprehension
in his eyes. &#8220;I think it would have
been wiser to have returned by the beach
road,&#8221; he added uncomplainingly, but Phil
thought only too truly.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_371">[371]</span>&#8220;Aye, aye, sir,&#8221; Childers replied, and as
the gun carriage was brought to a stop four
men picked up the gun, raising it upon
their shoulders. Childers removed the breech
mechanism for fear it would fall out. The
men with the gun on their shoulders waded
into the icy cold water.</p>

<p>The advance company had gone on barely
a hundred yards beyond the river, and there
had halted to permit the rear company and
the machine gun to catch up.</p>

<p>The men on the drag ropes of the gun
mount were on dry land when the midshipmen
left Lieutenant Morrison, with whom
they had been walking, and started ahead to
rejoin the leader.</p>

<p>A savage cry from out the jungle on the
left brought the entire command to immediate
attention. The cry was taken up and
increased in volume until the woods rang, and
then suddenly came a scattering volley of
musketry fire.</p>

<p>Phil and Sydney drew their revolvers.
They had halted, gazing in bewilderment
into the dense bush, from which there continued
to come a multitude of savage shouts<span class="pagenum" id="Page_372">[372]</span>
with a scorching rifle fire. The sailors ahead
had deployed along the road and were excitedly
but blindly firing.</p>

<p>Phil gazed behind him and saw the machine
gun had been hurriedly replaced upon
its mount, yet the gunner&#8217;s mate, Childers,
was storming furiously at the men about him.
They had dipped the breech of the gun into
the water in their sudden shock and surprise
at the weirdness of the attack.</p>

<p>Phil hastened back in hopes of being able
to lend a hand: his familiarity with the gun
qualified him for the task, but Childers had
already deftly put back the mechanism and
was about to feed in the cartridge tape carrying
the ammunition.</p>

<p>&#8220;Got any oil?&#8221; Phil asked excitedly.</p>

<p>Childers pointed to a can in the accessory
box whose top was open. Phil unscrewed the
top of the oil can and poured its contents over
the wetted breech and into the mechanism.</p>

<p>&#8220;Bring up the gun,&#8221; was the cry from the
advance company.</p>

<p>With a rush the sailors carried the gun and
carriage up the road and swung its muzzle
toward the concealed foes.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_373">[373]</span>Childers snapped a cartridge in place while
Lieutenant Morrison, seating himself upon the
trail of the mount, pointed and pulled the
trigger. One shot was heard and then the
mechanism jammed.</p>

<p>Again Childers drew back the gas lever, but
only one shot could be fired.</p>

<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s put together wrong,&#8221; the gunner&#8217;s
mate cried out aghast as he slipped out the
bolt and examined it.</p>

<p>&#8220;The Colt gun won&#8217;t work!&#8221; was the disheartening
news that spread up and down the
line. The unseen enemy had now become
bolder. Many of them disregarding the
danger, in their exultation, revealed their
half-naked bodies from behind trees, while
the sailors made good their expended ammunition
in dropping these in their tracks. The
white men were being attacked from all sides
save one and the volume of fire told only too
plainly that nearly a thousand rifles were
against them.</p>

<p>&#8220;We&#8217;ve got to get off this road and take
cover,&#8221; Phil cried in exasperation as he saw
men drop sorely hit near him. Lieutenant
Morrison&#8217;s face was pale and as he rose from<span class="pagenum" id="Page_374">[374]</span>
his seat on the gun carriage, he steadied himself
upon Patterson&#8217;s shoulder. His right leg
hung useless; a bullet had shattered the bone
below the knee.</p>

<p>The two midshipmen seized bayonets from
the guns of those fallen and began to hack
away at the barbed wire fence in their rear.
Others now joined them, while the most part of
the sailors threw themselves upon the ground
and continued their fire at the flitting figures,
only seldom and then dimly visible within the
impenetrable bush, on their front and flank.</p>

<p>Lieutenant Tupper was already severely
wounded, but he saw that to save his men
a retreat was urgently necessary. To remain
there in the open was useless and would prove
costly if not destructive.</p>

<p>The sailors retreated slowly through the
places in the fence, cut laboriously with the
bayonets.</p>

<p>&#8220;The gun must be abandoned, Childers,&#8221;
Lieutenant Morrison exclaimed in despair,
after they had dragged it through the torn
fence and Childers had made a last heroic
effort to disassemble the breech mechanism in
order to locate and repair the defect.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_375">[375]</span>The rebel natives perceiving the retreat
threw caution to the winds and now showed
themselves in a savage swarm. The sailors
made a desperate stand, and at such close range
the execution among their delirious enemies was
great; but nothing could stop their mad rush.</p>

<p>Phil clung to his wounded lieutenant on
one side, while Patterson supported him on
the other.</p>

<p>Cries for mercy could be heard behind
them, where a wounded sailor was discovered
by the eager savages. Then triumphant yells
and a scream of terror told the horrible story
of the poor fellow&#8217;s end.</p>

<p>&#8220;Leave me,&#8221; Lieutenant Morrison begged
them. &#8220;Save yourselves.&#8221;</p>

<p>The natives were almost within reach when
Lieutenant Morrison&#8217;s body suddenly sank to
the ground. A second bullet had reached a
vital spot. Phil stopped. Patterson was behind
him. He had emptied his revolver with
telling effect in holding the enemy at bay in
an endeavor to cover the retreat of his stricken
friend. Phil now sprang to the ensign&#8217;s aid
and as he did so he could have cried out for
joy, for there was O&#8217;Neil at his side, cool and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_376">[376]</span>
collected, among the terrible dangers, firing
his rifle from its magazine. Each shot carried
a message of death.</p>

<p>&#8220;Run, both of you,&#8221; the sailor cried out to
them. Phil saw Patterson reel, and caught
him in his arms. The lad turned the ensign
toward him and a great sob of anguish escaped
his lips as he saw the death pallor
already on the stricken officer&#8217;s face. The
next moment the lifeless body fell at his feet,
and almost touching the lifeless body of the
friend for whom he had heroically but fruitlessly
given his young life.</p>

<p>Turning upon the enemy, who had now
hesitated in their advance in face of such unexpected
resistance, Phil fired his revolver
until empty. Then a crash and a mighty
explosion almost threw him to the ground.</p>

<p>&#8220;Quick, sir, run; those are our shells,&#8221;
O&#8217;Neil exclaimed, and together the two raced
for the beach, guided in their flight by the
discharges from the guns of the &#8220;Sitka,&#8221;
while behind them the rebel natives were left
to exult over their victory. Again the invincible
white man&mdash;papalangi&mdash;had been found
to be only mortal.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER XXII<br />


<small>WAR IN EARNEST</small></h2>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">When</span> Phil and O&#8217;Neil reached the beach,
the &#8220;Sitka&#8217;s&#8221; shells were screeching angrily
over their heads and exploding in the bush
behind them. The sailors had been collected
and formed on the beach road to repel an
attack. Three officers and eight sailors were
missing and a score had received wounds.
The command of the force fell to a sub-lieutenant
from the English cruiser. Tupper,
Morrison and Patterson had been killed and
left upon the field.</p>

<p>&#8220;There were at least a thousand of them,&#8221;
Sydney exclaimed as he met Phil and grasped
his hand silently, thankful for his escape,
&#8220;and Scott or some white man was with
them. Many of the men say they distinctly
heard a white man&#8217;s voice encouraging the
natives to charge us.&#8221;</p>

<p>The sailors were apathetic, stunned. The<span class="pagenum" id="Page_378">[378]</span>
suddenness of the attack and their defeat had
unnerved every man of them.</p>

<p>&#8220;If we could only have used the machine
gun,&#8221; Childers moaned plaintively, &#8220;we&#8217;d
have had a different story to tell.&#8221;</p>

<p>Little by little the men&#8217;s shattered nerves
were mended. The &#8220;Sitka&#8217;s&#8221; shells yet
screeched overhead, but the rebel natives had
retired.</p>

<p>The commanding officer gave the order and
put the force in motion. It was a sadly disheartened
band that entered the town of
Ukula an hour later.</p>

<p>When the doleful news reached the American
admiral, he was beside himself with anger
at the white men whom he firmly believed
had instigated and made possible the ambush.
Far from yielding, all effort was now ordered
to be concentrated upon swift punishment to
the rebels.</p>

<p>Lieutenant Gant came ashore from the
British ship to command all the loyal native
troops. Several hundred loyal warriors were
now added, having been brought from Kulila.
One thousand strong they were mustered, and
all were armed with the latest patterns of the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_379">[379]</span>
Lee Metford rifle from the British and American
war-ships. The white troops, unused to bush
fighting, by the admiral&#8217;s order were hereafter
only to garrison the town, while offensive
work was to be done exclusively by the
loyal native troops. A plentiful supply of
white sailors was sprinkled among the native
companies, to teach them how to use their
weapons and how to take cover.</p>

<p>Through the women the fate of the fallen
officers and sailors was learned. All had been
beheaded; but Kataafa when he learned of
this savage act had ordered the bodies and
heads to be buried and their graves marked.</p>

<p>Phil and Sydney were given commands in the
native regiment, and O&#8217;Neil went with them.</p>

<p>All day and every day they drilled their
men. Meanwhile the rebels were drawing
their lines closer about Ukula.</p>

<p>The Herzovinian consul had, immediately
after the unfortunate fight with the rebels,
gone in person to offer his sympathy to the
admiral for the sad loss of life. Admiral
Spotts received him in stony silence. He
listened to his words but vouchsafed no answer,
nor even thanked him for his sympathy.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_380">[380]</span>&#8220;Against his countrymen, whom he should
control,&#8221; the admiral exclaimed to Commanders
Tazewell and Sturdy, after the discomfited
consul had departed, &#8220;the blood of
every man killed in these islands should
righteously cry out vengeance.&#8221;</p>

<p>Phil, who had been present, repeated the
admiral&#8217;s words to O&#8217;Neil. The sailorman
nodded his head in silence for several
minutes.</p>

<p>&#8220;What were you going to say?&#8221; Phil asked
quickly. He had seen a look in O&#8217;Neil&#8217;s
eyes, and knew that the sailor was looking
at the sad episode from a different standpoint.</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, sir,&#8221; O&#8217;Neil replied apologetically,
&#8220;I am not saying the admiral isn&#8217;t dead right.
That count and Klinger have sure brought
on this war and are responsible for the men
killed. But, sir,&#8221; he added, &#8220;I was here
when twenty Herzovinian sailors were killed
and their heads taken by this same Kataafa.
They were killed by bullets furnished by
Americans and Englishmen. They blamed
us then&mdash;we blame them now.</p>

<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t you see, sir,&#8221; he added earnestly,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_381">[381]</span>
&#8220;the Herzovinians think we are now &#8216;quits.&#8217;
They lost twenty sailors; we have lost eleven,
including three officers.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Now,&#8221; Sydney said thoughtfully, &#8220;is the
time for the white men to get together and
stop this useless war.&#8221;</p>

<p>Phil and O&#8217;Neil gazed at him in surprise.</p>

<p>&#8220;When we have lost our first battle,&#8221; Phil
exclaimed scornfully. &#8220;Why, Syd, that is
contrary to human nature. The Herzovinians
might be willing to compromise, but we cannot
accept a truce until we have proved that
our courage has not been affected. When we
have driven Kataafa away from Ukula, then
we might be willing to treat for an armistice,
but never before.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I agree with the humanitarian view of
Mr. Monroe,&#8221; a voice from behind them said
solemnly. The lads turned to find Judge
Lindsay beside them, smiling in fatherly
fashion upon them. &#8220;Now is the moment
of moments to bring together the warring
factions. To do so,&#8221; he added, &#8220;we must
sacrifice some of our selfish pride. But we
would thus spare innocent human lives.</p>

<p>&#8220;Have you heard that Klinger has been<span class="pagenum" id="Page_382">[382]</span>
arrested, and is now held in jail by our naval
forces for the crime of instigating the rebels
to attack our sailors?&#8221; he asked. The judge
spoke without sign of feeling.</p>

<p>&#8220;I cannot see,&#8221; he said after a pause, &#8220;what
evidence they have against him. He supplied
guns to natives to fight natives. That they
used their weapons against the white men I
am sure was not his wish.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Begging your worship&#8217;s pardon,&#8221; O&#8217;Neil
said respectfully, &#8220;Klinger was here ten
years ago, and saw twenty of his countrymen
killed through the work of white men
of our race. Do you believe, sir, he has forgotten
that? Klinger has no fear. When we
stood and talked with him at Vaileli before
the fight, I thought I saw a look in his face,
like one who believes something for which he
has long wished was about to happen. He
didn&#8217;t owe us anything, and the line of talk
we gave him didn&#8217;t make him feel any the
more kindly toward us. I am dead sure
now that he knew that Kataafa&#8217;s warriors
were between us and Ukula, waiting to attack
us, but the memory of the monument in
Kulinuu for the martyred Herzovinian sailors<span class="pagenum" id="Page_383">[383]</span>
kept his mouth shut tight. No, sir, he let us
go to our defeat almost with joy in his heart,
and somehow,&#8221; O&#8217;Neil added solemnly, almost
reverentially, &#8220;when I remember that terrible
day, just before the hurricane that
wrecked us all, I haven&#8217;t it in my heart to
blame him.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;So you were here then,&#8221; the judge exclaimed
in surprise and interest. &#8220;Well, I
wish I could be the instrument to bring together
the two sides, and bring peace to these
beautiful islands; but I suppose the blood of
our poor fellows cries out for atonement, and
we must fight on.&#8221;</p>

<p>Lieutenant Gant with his native regiment
was almost ready to take the offensive.</p>

<p>&#8220;We&#8217;ve got to be mighty keen about it,&#8221;
he exclaimed to some of his officers. &#8220;A
cable is on the way to New Zealand by the
mail ship that left to-day. The Powers will
soon put a stop to this show when they learn
the results of our first battle.&#8221;</p>

<p>But before Gant could take the field to
retrieve the defeat, Kataafa became suddenly
bold and advanced his lines within a couple
of hundred yards of the allies. They moved<span class="pagenum" id="Page_384">[384]</span>
during the night, and strange as it may seem
women did not bring the news beforehand.</p>

<p>Matautu was the point of attack, and the
foreign resident section was swept by bullets.</p>

<p>The natives taunted each other from their
earth intrenchments, firing wildly, but neither
side made an attempt to leave the protection
of their forts and attack.</p>

<p>Across the Fuisa River on the east of
Matautu the Kataafa and Panu warriors
faced each other, and here Lieutenant Gant
had despatched several native companies of
re&euml;nforcements to hold the road leading into
Ukula.</p>

<p>The sailors, by order of the admiral, had
been held in reserve. They were only to be
used in case Kataafa undertook to rush the
earthwork defenses. They held the second
line of defense.</p>

<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s a perfect shame,&#8221; O&#8217;Neil exclaimed
disgustedly, &#8220;to see these fellows throw away
their ammunition. Why, a squad of sailors
could have picked off twenty of those blackened
faced natives across there in the last ten
minutes.&#8221; He picked up the rifle that had
been idly lying beside him in the trench and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_385">[385]</span>
adjusted the sight to two hundred yards.
&#8220;Watch me lay out the next fellow who gets
funny and jumps on top of his fort and shakes
his fist at us.&#8221;</p>

<div class="figcenter"><img src="images/i_384.jpg" alt="" /></div>
<p class="caption">HE DID NOT FIRE</p>

<p>The midshipmen watched him interestedly,
for O&#8217;Neil was a dead shot.</p>

<p>Suddenly a fine looking warrior leaped
upon the trench, brandishing his gun and
head knife, using the forceful but picturesque
Kapuan tongue in boasts and taunts, hurling
them upon all those of his enemies across the
river.</p>

<p>O&#8217;Neil calmly raised his gun, but he did
not fire. He dropped it into the hollow of
his arm.</p>

<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s too much like murder,&#8221; he said, and
both midshipmen breathed a sigh of relief.</p>

<p>&#8220;This isn&#8217;t war,&#8221; Phil complained bitterly.
&#8220;We are fighting children. I&#8217;d as soon shoot
a schoolboy showing himself in bravado from
the top of his snow fort as to shoot at those
joyful warriors. To them fighting is fun.
They do not realize that they are uselessly
destroying human life.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Look!&#8221; Sydney exclaimed in admiration,
as a Kataafa warrior was seen to rush into the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_386">[386]</span>
river a few hundred yards above them and endeavor
to reach the body of a native whom he
had slain. A rain of bullets fell all around
him, and as he reached the side of his victim,
his head axe raised, he fell dead. So excited
had both sides become that no thought of personal
safety was given. Both sides stood upon
the top of their trenches and uttered their savage
cries of defiance. The Kataafa men who
had cheered on their hero, exulting in the prospect
of a trophy, saw themselves suddenly exposed
to a disgrace.</p>

<p>&#8220;We ought to stop it,&#8221; Sydney exclaimed.
&#8220;Look at our men exposing themselves needlessly.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You might as well try damming Niagara
first,&#8221; Phil returned. &#8220;It would be an easier
job.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;There&#8217;s the real thing for you,&#8221; O&#8217;Neil
cried, bringing his rifle up to his shoulder as
a lithe Kataafa native darted across the intervening
water scarcely half waist deep, swung
the dead body of his friend upon his back and
returned to his trenches unscathed.</p>

<p>&#8220;If they don&#8217;t stop this foolishness,&#8221; the
sailor said, &#8220;I&#8217;m going to teach &#8217;em a lesson.&#8221;<span class="pagenum" id="Page_387">[387]</span>
He lowered his rifle from his shoulder. &#8220;I
could have dropped him a half a dozen times,&#8221;
he complained, &#8220;and yet these wild savages
have wasted a barrel of lead shooting at him,
and not a single hit.&#8221;</p>

<p>The excitement along the Fuisa River began
to die down after this last piece of bravado.
O&#8217;Neil and the midshipmen had sent word
to the chiefs in their vicinity to save their ammunition.</p>

<p>About three o&#8217;clock those at the Fuisa River
were much concerned over heavy musketry
fire behind them and on the right flank of the
allied position. A woman came along the
road from Ukula, carrying fruit for her
relatives in the trenches.</p>

<p>O&#8217;Neil spoke to her, inquiring the cause
of the firing. She answered quite calmly and
passed on down the trench.</p>

<p>&#8220;She says she heard Kataafa would attack
along the Siumu road, and supposed that was
the cause of the firing,&#8221; O&#8217;Neil explained.
&#8220;There goes the artillery,&#8221; he exclaimed, as
all distinctly heard the crash from the village
in their rear where some English howitzers
were mounted. &#8220;They must have driven<span class="pagenum" id="Page_388">[388]</span>
the natives back. Look out!&#8221; he cried suddenly.</p>

<p>There was no need for further warning. The
midshipmen, glancing up over the top of the
trench, saw the Kataafa warriors were beyond
their trench and advancing toward the river,
firing, gesticulating, taunting, dancing and singing.
A hail of bullets met them from the Panu
side; but nothing seemed able to stop the
movement.</p>

<p>The contending factions were about equal
in numbers. The Kataafa men having willingly
abandoned their trench to fight in the
open, their enemy, not to be outdone in chivalry,
bravely mounted on top of their own
earthworks and awaited the attack. Meanwhile
both sides fired blindly. Neither side
took time to aim. Even with such poor fire
direction, however, many men on both sides
were being hit.</p>

<p>O&#8217;Neil and the two midshipmen had gotten
suddenly over their hesitancy in shooting down
a native enemy, and their example was being
followed by about fifty white men, after endeavoring
in vain to keep their natives under
cover.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_389">[389]</span>&#8220;Pick out the leaders,&#8221; O&#8217;Neil exclaimed.
&#8220;I got that fellow. I am sorry! he was such
a fine looker.&#8221; Again he fired, and each time
his exclamations told the result of his shot.</p>

<p>Phil and Sydney realized that it was not a
matter of choice. That rush had to be stopped,
even if the entire force against them was wiped
out, and they loaded and fired eagerly, but
carefully, every shot bringing down an
enemy.</p>

<p>&#8220;They&#8217;ve had enough!&#8221; Sydney cried joyously.
Those near had turned and were fleeing
back across the stream. Once the panic
had seized them, the entire Kataafa force was
fleeing for cover.</p>

<p>&#8220;Now after them,&#8221; O&#8217;Neil suggested to the
midshipmen, and this same thought had apparently
come to every white sailor along the
loyal line. An English sub-lieutenant some
hundred yards above had begun the sortie,
and presently the whole line was in the river
advancing rapidly after their fleeing foe.</p>

<p>Breathless, Phil found himself in the enemy&#8217;s
trenches. The natives had dashed on
into the bush to pursue their broken foe.</p>

<p>The trench made by Kataafa was quickly<span class="pagenum" id="Page_390">[390]</span>
razed and again the loyal warriors were
quietly, yet joyously, back in their own forts.</p>

<p>It was not until this lull in the fighting
that the midshipmen realized the extent of the
attack upon the center of the allies&#8217; position
along the Siumu road. The firing seemed
closer and in greater volume. The howitzers
had been re&euml;nforced by Gatlings and pom-poms,
or one-pounder automatic cannon, from
the English ship.</p>

<p>&#8220;I say, that looks as if the big attack were
down there,&#8221; the sub-lieutenant exclaimed
anxiously. He had come down to talk with
the midshipmen. &#8220;Suppose you take your
company and see if they need help. After
that rush I think we have more than plenty
to keep them off here.&#8221;</p>

<p>Phil, Sydney and O&#8217;Neil led forth about
one hundred excited natives on a run through
Matautu. In front of the legations two companies
of American sailors, forming the reserve
for the flank which the midshipmen had just
left, hurriedly joined on behind.</p>

<p>Ahead, in front of the Tivoli Hotel, the
artillery could be seen firing down the Siumu
road. The air was full of flying bullets, apparently<span class="pagenum" id="Page_391">[391]</span>
coming from all directions. The
entire stretch of road from the American consulate
was bullet swept. Phil saw that it was
deserted, but he could not stop to take cover.
It was evident that on the Siumu road the
biggest attack was being made. As the natives
and sailors approached Phil saw several companies
of white men advancing from the other
direction. He soon recognized the English
from Kulinuu, coming to re&euml;nforce the center.</p>

<p>Lieutenant Gant, mounted upon a pony,
in all that hail of bullets came galloping
toward the midshipmen.</p>

<p>&#8220;Go straight down the road,&#8221; he ordered.
Phil marveled at his calmness. &#8220;They&#8217;ve
driven our natives back almost into the town.
The guns are shelling behind them. It&#8217;s only
making noise. We can&#8217;t shoot into them for
fear of hitting our own.&#8221;</p>

<p>The extra three hundred arriving turned
the tide of battle. The Panu natives, encouraged
by their white officers and sailors from
the war-ships, now turned and charged their
enemy. The impetus of the re&euml;nforcements
carried them through the front ranks of the
enemy and into the middle of the horde.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_392">[392]</span>
Out in the jungle the natives spread out, and
each line was quickly re&euml;nforced by squads of
sailors.</p>

<p>By four o&#8217;clock the attack had been repulsed,
and the loyal natives and their allies
were again withdrawn into their forts. All
the Kataafa forts taken had been destroyed.</p>

<p>Many heads were brought into the town,
but these were ordered buried, and the natives,
after some grumbling, finally complied.</p>

<p>Phil and Sydney saw the heads collected by
native chiefs appointed by Lieutenant Gant.
One head in the gruesome pile gave him a
start that he will always remember. It was
that once proudly carried by Captain &#8220;Bully&#8221;
Scott. The grayish whiskers and long matted
locks of once black hair, but now turning
gray. The usually sun-brown face had turned
to an ashen pallor. Yet the likeness in death
was as vivid as in life.</p>

<p>Phil had the head taken up and wrapped
in tapa cloth, and then carried it to Commander
Tazewell.</p>

<p>In front of the Tivoli Hotel they found
him.</p>

<p>Phil quickly explained his mission.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_393">[393]</span>All retired inside the hotel while a box was
ordered brought.</p>

<p>Phil laid his ghastly relic on the floor and
gingerly unwrapped it.</p>

<p>All gazed upon it in silence. Commander
Tazewell nodded, and Phil rewrapped the
head carefully and placed it within the box.</p>

<p>As they left the hotel O&#8217;Neil brought up
the native who claimed to have taken the
head.</p>

<p>&#8220;He says he didn&#8217;t kill him,&#8221; O&#8217;Neil said,
&#8220;but I think probably he did, and is afraid
to say so. He thinks we are displeased because
it was a white man.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Who did it? Ask him,&#8221; Phil ordered.</p>

<p>&#8220;He says a white man shot him. He saw
it, and when the white man didn&#8217;t take the
head, he did,&#8221; O&#8217;Neil replied, after a short
conversation.</p>

<p>The native so closely questioned by these
white officers was becoming very much concerned.
His eyes rolled from side to side
seeking apparently somebody to take his part.
Finally he leaped away and grabbing a man
by the arm dragged him excitedly toward his
inquisitors.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_394">[394]</span>It was Stump.</p>

<p>&#8220;He kill! He kill!&#8221; the native cried out
pointing his finger at the surprised white
man.</p>

<small>CONCLUSION</small></h2>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">Stump</span> was not proud of his exploit. The
lads saw that he trembled violently, and his
face showed that his nerves were unstrung.</p>

<p>&#8220;It was my life or his,&#8221; he said sorrowfully.
&#8220;Klinger had put me in charge of the store
when he was arrested. During the fight on
the Siumu road I was inside the store. Scott
and several natives came from the bush and
made me go with them. I was afraid to refuse.
They led me away. Some time later
our party was attacked by the Panu men.
They did not attack Captain Scott, who held
me by the arm and told me he&#8217;d blow my
head off if I ran away. When the Kataafa
men were running away Scott saw that we
must run too. He beat and kicked me to
make me go faster. I had been wounded in
the left arm.&#8221; Here Stump showed his bandaged<span class="pagenum" id="Page_396">[396]</span>
arm. &#8220;The wound hurt me and made
me desperate. By this time we were surrounded
by Panu men. I appealed to them
for help, but they only laughed. One man,
however, came to me and handed me a gun.
Scott did not see what was done; he was dragging
me along toward the retreating Kataafa
men.</p>

<p>&#8220;The next thing I knew,&#8221; Stump declared,
a strong fit of trembling seizing him at the
thought, &#8220;I had stuck the muzzle of the gun
close to his neck and pulled the trigger. He
let go his hold of me and I ran. I heard the
shouts and laughter of the natives behind
me.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I reckon you won&#8217;t be hung for it,&#8221;
O&#8217;Neil said consolingly. &#8220;The killing of
that scoundrel and pirate is probably the most
useful thing for humanity you&#8217;ve ever done,
Stump. Now I advise you to dig out on the
next steamer and go home.&#8221;</p>

<p>The defenders of Ukula at last were able to
relax in a measure their vigilance. The Kataafa
warriors had been badly shattered, and
further attacks were not likely until they
could replenish their store of ammunition.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_397">[397]</span>
The arrest of Klinger blocked one source of
supply. Many thousands of rounds fitting
the enemy&#8217;s rifles had been found by the
allied sailors after a search of the Kapuan
firm&#8217;s store. Kataafa had probably counted
upon the capture of Ukula long enough to restock
his expended ammunition.</p>

<p>The midshipmen dined that evening with
the Lees. Alice was eager to hear the
gruesome details of the fighting and was
greatly surprised when the lads declared that
neither they nor O&#8217;Neil had been wounded.</p>

<p>&#8220;How could you help being?&#8221; she asked
doubtingly. &#8220;The air all afternoon was full
of lead. We all hid behind furniture stacked
up like a fort up-stairs. The house was hit,
you know, lots of times.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Where&#8217;s Avao?&#8221; Phil asked; he had not
seen her for several days.</p>

<p>&#8220;She was with her father in the trenches,&#8221;
Alice replied, admiration in her eyes. &#8220;She
was here an hour ago and told us all about
the fight.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; Miss Lee added smiling upon her
enthusiastic sister, &#8220;Alice was restrained
from being on the scene only by force. Father<span class="pagenum" id="Page_398">[398]</span>
and I had all we could do to keep her
at home.&#8221;</p>

<p>After dinner Admiral Spotts and Commander
Tazewell came in to confer with
Mr. Lee.</p>

<p>&#8220;I have just found out,&#8221; the admiral said,
&#8220;that the Herzovinian war-ship brought a refusal
of annexation to Kataafa, and Count
Rosen was informed that he must act in
concert with other nations to prevent bloodshed.
The count returns to-morrow in the
mail steamer for Australia.&#8221;</p>

<p>At daylight the next morning Lieutenant
Gant led his entire native regiment over the
road taken by the small force some days before.
The enemy was not encountered until
they arrived at the Vaileli plantation. There
a few shots were exchanged, but the Kataafa
men were not in force and quickly scattered
into the bush. The advance guard under
Tuamana pursued them and returned after a
half hour&#8217;s chase with several native heads,
and besides carrying the body of a white man,
who had been shot and killed fleeing with the
Kataafa men. It was the missing marine
orderly, Schultz.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_399">[399]</span>The regiment returned over the same road
recently traversed by the ill-fated party. The
midshipmen and O&#8217;Neil sought for the Colt
gun. Childers had dismounted the breech
mechanism during that disastrous battle and
brought it to the beach with him upon his retreat.
The gun had been taken away by the
Kataafa warriors, although they were unable
to use it. No signs of bodies or arms were
found; the victors had carried away all spoils
of their vanquished enemy.</p>

<p>When the expedition reached Ukula, the
mail steamer from San Francisco was in port.
The admiral, the war-ship captains and the
three consuls had held a meeting to discuss
the instructions received in the mail from
their respective governments.</p>

<p>&#8220;A commission has been appointed to
finally decide the fate of Kapua,&#8221; Commander
Tazewell told the lads as they joined
him after turning over their native company
to its native chief. &#8220;We are sending word to
Kataafa declaring a truce. He has retired
with all his warriors to Saluafata. Klinger
will carry the message and the mail steamer
is to wait until he returns. Klinger has<span class="pagenum" id="Page_400">[400]</span>
agreed to leave the islands. He and Count
Rosen go together.&#8221;</p>

<p>The midshipmen were delighted. The war
had ceased to be exciting. They felt that the
useless killing of natives should stop. It had
gone too far already. With Rosen, Klinger
and Scott out of the way, a peaceful settlement
would be possible.</p>

<p>They told the captain of the death of his
unfaithful orderly and of burying him at
Vaileli.</p>

<p>Commander Tazewell was thoughtful for
several minutes. &#8220;Poor fellow,&#8221; he said. &#8220;I
suppose he could not withstand the golden
bribe offered him.&#8221;</p>

<p>Kataafa sent in word that he agreed to suspend
hostilities and would remain in Saluafata,
ten miles away from Ukula.</p>

<p>The mail steamer departed, carrying with
it the two men who had overreached themselves
in their patriotic endeavor to bring
Kapua under the control of their own nation.</p>

<p>The American and English sailors and the
natives loyal to Panu meanwhile garrisoned
and preserved order in Ukula and over the
surrounding country.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_401">[401]</span>Stump was rewarded and sent home on a
mail steamer, promising to look up his folks
and turn over a new leaf.</p>

<p>One day, several weeks after the last fight,
another American war-ship came to anchor
in the harbor of Ukula. On board were three
great commissioners of the treaty powers.</p>

<p>Two days later Phil and Sydney said good-bye
to their friends in Ukula. The war-ships
&#8220;Sitka&#8221; and &#8220;Sacramento&#8221; were under orders
to return to the United States.</p>

<p>As the two war-ships lifted their anchors,
many canoes filled with natives hung in the
quiet water about them. The sweet plaintive
air of the Kapuan farewell song floated up to
the ears of the midshipmen, really sorry to
leave behind those for whom they had formed
a strong bond of friendship.</p>

<p>Some days later the midshipmen dined in
the cabin with Commander Tazewell.</p>

<p>&#8220;What has Herzovinia gained in Kapua
after all the years of stirring up uncertainty
and strife?&#8221; Sydney asked earnestly.</p>

<p>&#8220;Her policy has been to prove to the other
nations that the islands are not worth the
trouble to govern them,&#8221; the commander answered.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_402">[402]</span>
&#8220;She has proved that the three nation
control cannot be carried on with peace. She
has lost her own sailors in fighting rebels and
we have lost ours.</p>

<p>&#8220;She still persists in her desire for the
islands. England and America are almost on
the point of giving up the struggle. You will
find,&#8221; he added, &#8220;that Herzovinia will be
given most if not all of Kapua by the commission
now working for a settlement there.&#8221;</p>

<p>The midshipmen remembered this accurate
summing up when a month or so later the
decision of the commission was given out to
the world.</p>

<p>&#8220;Know what you want, and always keep
wanting it and trying to get it; it&#8217;s a cinch
that you can&#8217;t miss it,&#8221; was O&#8217;Neil&#8217;s moral,
derived from his Kapuan experiences.</p>

Creating the works from print editions not protected by U.S. copyright

royalties. Special rules, set forth in the General Terms of Use part
of this license, apply to copying and distributing Project

and may not be used if you charge for an eBook, except by following
the terms of the trademark license, including paying royalties for use
of the Project Gutenberg trademark. If you do not charge anything for
copies of this eBook, complying with the trademark license is very
easy. You may use this eBook for nearly any purpose such as creation
of derivative works, reports, performances and research. Project
Gutenberg eBooks may be modified and printed and given away--you may
do practically ANYTHING in the United States with eBooks not protected

To protect the Project Gutenberg&#8482; mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase &#8220;Project
Gutenberg&#8221;), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full
Project Gutenberg&#8482; License available with this file or online at

Section 1. General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.A. By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg&#8482;
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement. If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or
destroy all copies of Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works in your
possession. If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a
Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic work and you do not agree to be bound
by the terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person
or entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.B. &#8220;Project Gutenberg&#8221; is a registered trademark. It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement. There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See
paragraph 1.C below. There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works if you follow the terms of this
agreement and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg&#8482;
electronic works. See paragraph 1.E below.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.C. The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation (&#8220;the
Foundation&#8221; or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection
of Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works. Nearly all the individual
works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg&#8482; mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg&#8482;
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg&#8482; name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg&#8482; License when
you share it without charge with others.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are
in a constant state of change. If you are outside the United States,
check the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this
agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg&#8482; work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country other than the United States.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.E. Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.E.1. The following sentence, with active links to, or other
immediate access to, the full Project Gutenberg&#8482; License must appear
prominently whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg&#8482; work (any work
on which the phrase &#8220;Project Gutenberg&#8221; appears, or with which the
phrase &#8220;Project Gutenberg&#8221; is associated) is accessed, displayed,
performed, viewed, copied or distributed:
</div>

<blockquote>
  <div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
    This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere in the United States and most
    other parts of the world at no cost and with almost no restrictions
    whatsoever. You may copy it, give it away or re-use it under the terms
    of the Project Gutenberg License included with this eBook or online
    at <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org">www.gutenberg.org</a>. If you

</blockquote>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.E.2. If an individual Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic work is
derived from texts not protected by U.S. copyright law (does not
contain a notice indicating that it is posted with permission of the
copyright holder), the work can be copied and distributed to anyone in
the United States without paying any fees or charges. If you are
redistributing or providing access to a work with the phrase &#8220;Project
Gutenberg&#8221; associated with or appearing on the work, you must comply
either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 or
obtain permission for the use of the work and the Project Gutenberg&#8482;
trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.E.3. If an individual Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any
additional terms imposed by the copyright holder. Additional terms
will be linked to the Project Gutenberg&#8482; License for all works
posted with the permission of the copyright holder found at the
beginning of this work.

active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; License.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.E.6. You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including
any word processing or hypertext form. However, if you provide access
to or distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg&#8482; work in a format
other than &#8220;Plain Vanilla ASCII&#8221; or other format used in the official
version posted on the official Project Gutenberg&#8482; website
(www.gutenberg.org), you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense
to the user, provide a copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means
of obtaining a copy upon request, of the work in its original &#8220;Plain
Vanilla ASCII&#8221; or other form. Any alternate format must include the
full Project Gutenberg&#8482; License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.E.8. You may charge a reasonable fee for copies of or providing
access to or distributing Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
provided that:

<div style='margin-left:0.7em;'>
    <div style='text-indent:-0.7em'>
        &#8226; You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
        the use of Project Gutenberg&#8482; works calculated using the method
        you already use to calculate your applicable taxes. The fee is owed
        to the owner of the Project Gutenberg&#8482; trademark, but he has
        agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the Project
        Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation. Royalty payments must be paid
        within 60 days following each date on which you prepare (or are

        payments should be clearly marked as such and sent to the Project

        &#8226; You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies

        License. You must require such a user to return or destroy all
        copies of the works possessed in a physical medium and discontinue
        all use of and all access to other copies of Project Gutenberg&#8482;
        works.
    </div>

    <div style='text-indent:-0.7em'>
        &#8226; You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of
        any money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
        electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days of
        receipt of the work.
    </div>

    <div style='text-indent:-0.7em'>

1.E.9. If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project
Gutenberg&#8482; electronic work or group of works on different terms than
are set forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing
from the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the manager of
the Project Gutenberg&#8482; trademark. Contact the Foundation as set
forth in Section 3 below.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.F.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg&#8482;
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain &#8220;Defects,&#8221; such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the &#8220;Right
of Replacement or Refund&#8221; described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg&#8482; electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees. YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3. YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.F.3. LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from. If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person
or entity providing it to you may choose to give you a second
opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If
the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing
without further opportunities to fix the problem.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.F.4. Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you &#8216;AS-IS&#8217;, WITH NO
OTHER WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT
LIMITED TO WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.F.5. Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of
damages. If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement
violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the
agreement shall be interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or
limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or
unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the
remaining provisions.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.F.6. INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works in
accordance with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the
production, promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg&#8482;
electronic works, harmless from all liability, costs and expenses,
including legal fees, that arise directly or indirectly from any of
the following which you do or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this
or any Project Gutenberg&#8482; work, (b) alteration, modification, or
additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg&#8482; work, and (c) any
Defect you cause.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg&#8482;
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg&#8482;&#8217;s
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg&#8482; collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg&#8482; and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; depends upon and cannot survive without widespread
public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine-readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular state
visit <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org/donate/">www.gutenberg.org/donate</a>.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Please check the Project Gutenberg web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Most people start at our website which has the main PG search
facility: <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org">www.gutenberg.org</a>.

including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
